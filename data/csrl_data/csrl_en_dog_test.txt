[agent] Well generally I enjoy movies . They give me a break from reality . [human] I can appreciate that . Have you ever seen the movie , The Notebook ? [agent] I have n't seen that one yet . Who stars in it ? [human] Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams . They both do a fantastic job , but I think the real power of that movie comes from the story itself . If you want an escape from reality , that 's the movie to check out . [agent] Hmm I do like both of those actors . Can you tell me a little about the plot ? [human] Without ruining it , all I can say is that it 's a love story set in the 1940 's . [agent] That sounds like a very interesting movie . Do the actors get along well ? [human] That 's what 's great about it , in a way they get a long , but there is also a lot of tension there because of events that happen in the movie . [agent] It sounds like it 's dramatic . I do like those sort of movies . How does the supporting cast work ini t ? [human] The supporting cast is good . Everything fits into place nicely , James Marsden , and Joan Allen . I do n't want to ruin anything by telling you too much about their roles , but they all give respectable performances . [agent] I can understand that . What 's the general setting of the movie ? [human] It 's set most in South Carolina , and you can feel the southern warmth it has .

The American President and The West Wing are two of my favourites - do you like this writing ? [agent] i NEVER KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT THIS FILM OR ABOUT ZUCKERBERG I HAVE N'T HEARD OF HIM ACTUALLY . . BUT I LOVE THE WEST WING ! HAVE YOU READ THE ACCIDENTAL BILLIONAIRES ? [human] It follows Facebook the early years in a way . Originally it was set up on one campus in the US and then spread across the world to what we eventually know Facebook as today . I think I got my FB account around Christmas 2006 and hardly anyone else was on it ! [agent] DID YOU HAVE A MYSPACE AS WELL ? [human] No I have n't read the book . I saw the film before even realising it was from a book originally . Normally I 'm quite hot on trying to read the book before seeing a film adaptation . [agent] I BECAME SOMEWHAT ADDICTED TO SOCIAL MEDIA DURING THE MYSPACE CRAZE . [human] I did have MySpace too ! It was the place to be at the time ! I learnt basic HTML by messing about with my MySpace profile - I believe it 's still ive somewhere ! [agent] IM NOT SO MUCH ANYMORE [human] still live even ! [agent] LOL . . I STILL CAN LOG ON TO MINE . SO ARE YOU A STUDENT ? [human] So the book was written but i think it was written by someone on the outside looking in rather than someone actually involved in Facebook . No I graduated in 2007 . I 'm in my 30s now and feel very old when I talk about video cassettes or a Walkman !|||15 14 14 14 14 13 13 13 13 13 13 12 12 12 12 12 12 12 12 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 3 3 3 3 3 3 2 2 2 2 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ARG0 O O O O O O B-V B-ARG1 I-ARG1 B-TMP I-TMP I-TMP I-TMP I-TMP I-TMP I-TMP I-TMP I-TMP O

I love his movies . What do you think of Jaws ? [agent] I liked that the characters were actually developed into human beings instead of just being one - dimensional . I wish there were more female characters though . The only lead female was the wife of a main character . What did you think of Jaws ? [human] I think it 's OK . I happen to agree with one reviewer who said that characters are simply functions of the action .

I felt like I can totally agree with the statement saying its totally the kind of traps that any 8 year old could devise if he had a budget of ten thousand dollars and a film crew . I do n't think any 8 year old could do all of that . sorry that . [human] Agreed . His traps definitely make the film seem implausible ; but the slapstick humor certainly can be enjoyed by some . [agent] Who was your favorite character in the movie comedy wise ? [human] Comedy wise , I enjoyed Kevin the most .
