Do you like comedies?", "Yes I like comedies, but I wouldn't want to show too many violent situations to children. If it were just me, though, this movie sounds a bit simplistic for an adult. Do you think an adult or an adult couple would enjoy this movie on their own? Or do you think this movie is more targeted towards children or families?", "I think an adult alone or as a couple could enjoy this movie. Any adult can remember their childhood and this movie takes was filmed in the 1990's. The violence is PG. There isn't any blood and those getting hurt always get right back up and are ready for more mishaps. This move is geared towards families."]}

When they walked together to their cars, it was clear for me that there was a chemistry Even though they didn´t want to accept it", "Somewhat. There were aspects I liked and didn't like.

He played Ra's al Ghul and Henri Ducard in Batman Begins. The other villain was Scarecrow!", "I’m remember scare crow in the animated series. He was freaky!", "Agreed. Batman had to fight to stop both he and Ra's from plunging Gotham City into chaos! Are you a fan of Gary Oldman?", "He was Commissioner Gordon in the other movies! Excellent actor. You are really getting me to want to see it again lol!", "I highly recommend you see it! Despite being released in 2005, it's still critically acclaimed! The beginning seeing Bruce fall into the well and getting attacked by a swarm of bats just sucks you right in and hooks you!", "Now... would you say it’s better than the Dark Knight?", "It's honestly hard for me to say. As one critic said, \"it's both comic book archetypes and real people\" which it seemingly is!", "Yeah this movie really began the trend of realistic superhero movies", "Very true! I liked how it jumped 14 years into the future, showing Bruce intending to murder Chill - the man who killed his own parents  before an assassin for the mob boss he was testifying against (Carmine Falcone) guns him down instead! And Ducard training him as a member of the League of Shadows was so awesome!"]}

It was enjoyable to see his personality change from the beginning to the end, in a good way! I agree that it is suitable for all ages, which is also a plus. Everyone can enjoy it for different reasons, but it's a movie that all ages can watch, so there was no need to cover ears or eyes at anytime like some movies...", "Did they have a sequel to this movie? I didn't get to see that one", "I believe so. There may have actually been two out since this one. I'm not entirely sure. I'm surprised that the ratings are so varied: A, 81%, 72%, and a 6.8/10... I am surprised some were lower than 80 as it was a decent movie. It says there was a song by Pharell. Do you know what song it was?", "Sometimes you can't really trust the ratings. I don't always go totally by it was it Happy?", "That's true! I feel like it didn't start out happy, but the more he bonded with the kids, the happier the movie got. What do you think? Interestingly, after reading the key scenes, I don't remember a lot of what happened in the movie. I need to watch it again.

{"conversation": ["Hi", "Hey there! So, the movie I got is inception.  I really think it would be a good watch for you. It was rated really highly on IMDB and Rotten tomatoes so that's already a good sign. Leonardo DiCaprio is the lead, he portrays a thief that steals information from peoples dreams. One critic response states \"wildly ingenious chess game\" so if you're into deep psychological thrillers that's definitely another plus. Do you like movies in the scientific genre?"]}

That does sound sad in terms of his upbringing. Poor kid!", "Yeah, but the kid is big and athletic so his friend's dad gets him on a football team. And then he makes friends with a kid named SJ.", "So cool! Who is SJ?", "SJ is the character who plays Sandra Bullock's kid. So that's how the athletic kid \"mike\" meets Leigh (Sandra Bullock). She eventually tries to become his legal guardian. it's very sweet.", "Oh okay! That makes sense and also makes the film even more appealing! Do you know who directed the film?", "Yeah; John Lee Hancock. I think he did a great job.", "It sounds like a great movie so I believe he did as well just based on what you're telling me.

She has a lot of versatility in the role as she shifts between professional assistant to fiery love interest. What are your thoughts on the character Yinsen?", "I agree.

Do you think that Stark should feel responsible for who he sells weapons to? Is he a bad person at the beginning of the film?", "I think he lacks awareness, preferring to be more of a playboy billionaire. If he's bad, it's only because he's unaware of what Obadiah is doing.

Anything in specific you can tell me about it that makes it stand out?", "Well, It's based on a book, so you know its gotta be from a well told story", "That's for sure.  Do you know what it covers basically?", "Its a biography, so it covers a true story. It's about a football player with a rough childhood", "I'm assuming the football player overcomes a lot of adversity as an adult as well?", "The movie focuses more on his early life, and his life as a young adult", "Ah, that's good news to me..I'm not the hugest fan of the sports side of movies.  So it's more on him as a person than the actual football?", "Yeah, there's certainly football involved, but the movie is mainly about how he overcomes adversity with the help of people that come into his life", "Do you know if there is any tragedy in it?  I do love me some drama here and there.", "There's quite a bit of tragic happening. The football player's mother was a drug addict", "Ouch.  Do you know offhand who's starring in the movie?", "Sandra Bullock is the biggest star. Her performance was considered great", "Ah, she's a great actress.  Do you know if any awards were won by the movie?", "Not to my knowledge, however I know the scores the movie got. It has an A+ on CinemaScore", "That's a pretty admirable rating.  Do you know who directed it?", "John Lee Hancock did", "Him I don't know haha, but if he's working with Sandra he must be good.  In your opinion is this a family friendly movie?  Like would my 10 year old be able to enjoy it?", "I think that with parental guidance the film could definitely be suitable for young audiences. Depending on your opinion though, the themes of this movie could be too heavy for a child under 13", "Disregarding the themes, do you think it's a pretty easy movie to follow, even if you aren't a huge football fanatic?", "Yes, the plot doesn't focus on the football as much, so a knowledge of football isn't needed", "Awesome.  Do you happen to know approximately how long it is?", "No, I don't"]}

He was upset over something wasn't he?", "He is an ex hitman who returns to that world after his wife died. Alfie Allen is the punky foolish son of a Russian Crime family who steals John Wick's car and killed his new puppy that his dead wife sent to John.", "Terrible! He seeks revenge?", "Oh yeah, goes nuts!  Killing everyone and getting even.  It was awesome!", "Sounds like. Did others try to harm him?", "Of course!  The entire Russian enterprise was out to get him. He killed everyone that got in his way or tried to kill him.", "He got Alfie too?", "He got Alfie in a club and had no remorse.  Just a cold execution, while fending off all his bodyguards, who failed in their job to protect Alfie.", "Serves him right! He didn't get innocent victims though?", "No one was innocent in this film..lol But no, he didn't kill any innocents.", "lol, I'm sure there was plenty trying to stop him too. Did he decide to go back to this as a profession?", "No, he only got the revenge on the people who harmed him and then went back to being a \"normal\" guy.", "Think it be hard to do that huh lol. I wonder if he will get a new puppy?", "At the end of the movie, he does get another dog, just not  a puppy.", "Sounds like he needs a friend. He made some enemies along the way?", "I don't think he made any new enemies, just the original Russian family and according henchmen.  Again, no innocent people were in the film.  Each character had a specific role within the \"hitman\" world.  Winston, played by Ian McShane, was the safe hotel where no matter what your assignment was as a hitman, you could go and stay and the hotel, but of course, one of the rules of the hotel was, no business on the grounds.", "But, he still conducted business there?", "but he didn't initiate it. Business meant killing.", "Well, can't blame him for protecting himself. Did he encounter female assassins?"]}

What about you?", "Yes Lindsay Lohan really played her role well to show how social cliques are bad in society.", "This movie was highly praised by critics. Do you usually like to see movies with high ratings?", "Yeah, I remember the Rolling Stones called it comic gold. I love high ratings for a movie, but there are some good ones with low ratings. Even this movie has Metacritic score of 66/100 but I think it should be higher. What else did you like about it?", "I enjoyed that it dealt with the serious topic of female high school cliques through comedy. I thought Tina Fey adapted Rosalind Wiseman's book \"Queen Bees and Wannabes\" well into a film. Do you generally like comedies?", "The social cliques damage girls and that is why it was referred to as a \"knockout.\" It even made  one of the top 50 greatest teen comedies Comedies are great, especially this one. The reference to the clique girls as Plastics makes me laugh Did you know it got a cinema score of A-?", "Haha yeah, hearing Jan and Damian describe the Plastics to Cady was great. Wow, that's a good score. It seems like CinemaScore appreciated having the great team of Lindsay Lohan, Tina Fey, and Mark Waters together.", "When Cady joins the Plastics, Janis plots revenge because she is excluded and uses Cady as ammo. Who else is your favorite character?", "I liked Janis because she started plotting against the Plastics and welcomed Cady when she arrived. Regina is interesting too because she's the most popular. Why do you think the Plastics invited Cady to sit with them at lunch?", "Rachel McAdams as Regina George complemented the role played by Lindsay Lohan, Cady because she plays queen bee real well. I think she invited Cady to sit with them to smell the roses and see if Cady was Plastics material, outside appearance having already qualified. What is another scene you like?", "Oh yes I think you're right. I liked the scene where Principal Duvall called all the girls into the gym to settle the problems caused by the Burn Book. Could you believe that Janis actually confronted Regina?"]}

Do you inherently dislie his movies ?", "I'm not sure if I've seen any of his other movies. Gatsby was visually appealing but I would argue it's lacking in substance. Perhaps that's a characteristc of Lurhmann", "i think he is quite the visionary, and the production standard is always high. I enjoyed first season of the 'get down'.. do you think the use of 3D in the movie was warranted? oops, there is no mention of 3D...", "I'm not sure if there was 3D or not, if there was I don't remember it standing out at all, which is pretty common in a lot of movies", "is there anything else we should discuss about this movie? did you think everyone was cast properly? Leo was good, and Carey. Tobey, i can't get past spiderman personally didn't like Joel, didn't feel American enough", "I liked Leo, Carey, and Tobey well enough, though I thought there wasn't enough chemistry between Leo and Carey to make the love story believable, since it was such a big focus of the movie", "yes, that was probably Leo's acting dilemma :)"]}

Plus I believe some parts are made up to spice the movie up", "But that is wrong, if it is biographical.  It runs the risks of portraying some people in a bad light. That is why it is sometimes better to read the book.  It was based off a book, by the way.", "Yes 95% of that movie is real but when the parts they left out come around I believe some of it is made up to fill in the gaps that would be left by withholding some of the issues", "Still, it is very informative.

It sounds like one I would like", "I'm not sure what the lawsuits were about. I guess the movie is based on a book about accidental billionaires. The movie came out in 2010. Columbia Pictures made it.", "Well know my curiousity is really peaked. I would like to know how facebook came about. Wasn't there another site like it before it came out. Thats pretty old I should be able to find it somewhere online. Have you seen it", "No, I haven't seen it. One of the important scenes is when Zucker makes a insulting website called Facemash while he is at Harvard. He got six months probation from the school, but look at how much money that brought him. Have you heard of Jesse Eisenberg? He plays Zuckerberg.", "No kidding, he is pretty young too. I guess the internet  business is rough from time to time. I have heard that he is not particularly pleasant No I don't recognize that name but sometimes I recognize the actor and can't ever remember the name. How rich is Zucker he must be in the billions", "If you watch the movie, you should see what you think of how Zuckerberg is portrayed. He was not consulted when the movie was made.", "That doesn't seem right. I would think you would have to have permission to do a story about someones life. I will watch it probably tonight if I can find it. I am sure he wasn't too pleased He sits owns facebook doesn't he Meant still owns"]}
{"conversation": ["What is the movie about?", "You should see Frozen since it's one of the best-animated musicals to come out of Disney.  Two sisters fight an eternal winter.", "That sounds interesting.Who are the main characters Nams? Names?", "The main characters are two sisters, Elsa, the Snow Queen of Arendelle and Anna, the Princess of Arendelle.   There is also Kristoff who is an iceman with a reindeer named Sven.", "You say its a musical. How did you like the music?", "Frozen has top musical ratings from a variety of critics with stunning broadway quality music.", "Sounds like a movie, I would be interested in seeing. Does the movie have a lot of comedy in it?", "It's the 53rd animated Disney animated feature film and has a clever plot and great music.  You would like it. Yes, it's a comedy-adventure film", "Sounds like it would be a great film for the kids Some movies even kids movies have inappropriate scenes did you see any", "There are lots of jokes in it as well, it's definitely a kids movie. Not inappropriate but the sister's parents die at sea during a storm which may be a dark subject", "That could upset some younger children with the parents dying at sea However, I think for some older kids the subject will not be upsetting", "There are also scenes where Elsa hurts her sister with magic.  But it's part of the lesson told by the movie which is inspired by Han's Christian Anderson's Snow Queen Faity Tale", "Now you say lessons. Is the movie overly preachy", "It is more entertaining than preachy, focusing on family entertainment.", "Okay, good. What parts would you say would stick out among the rest", "Sister Elsa does become upset when her sister falls in love with a Duke at Elsa's crowning which causes her to unleash her powers and put Arendale into a permanent winter, freezing everything and making a magnificent ice palace in the process. Elsa vows to live a solitary life after she's called a monster", "Wow, very intriguing. Why do you think Elsa was so upset by her sisters choice to fall in love with Duke?", "Elsa objects to a very quick engagement, it causes her to accidentally show her powers to the court and town", "Sounds like a very pivotal point in the movie How do you think this affected Anna?"]}
{"conversation": ["hi", "Good morning, Does this sound like a good movie to you?", "yes, it sounds pretty good,  what are your thoughts?", "It seems to be heart warming and emotional. I tend to avoid these types of movies like the plague.", "oh ok, I get what you're saying", "BUT, it's a Disney animated musical. Those are usually good - even with the princesses and the \"happily ever afters.\"", "yes they are usually very good as far as animated movie go", "Do you think you want to watch it?", "kids will surely love this yes i will watch it with my daughter will you?", "I have a very jaded son. I don't think he wants to see this. BUT, it's in 3-D. That makes it a maybe. The ice man might be a source of action and adventure. Princesses usually aren't. Out of control ice magic is good. Being Disney, no one will die tho'. So, it's still a maybe for me and my boy.", "Yeah, he might also like the pet reindeer too", "Oh wait, the parents die - but I'm sure that's off screen.", "oh yeah, theres always at least one parent dead in a disney film so nothing new there", "I think this would be a good discussion starter with my son tho. Talking about learning to control your emotions (i.e. ice powers) as opposed to suppressing them. We home school. So, everything we do is a lesson.", "yeah that would be good.  we homeschooled last year :)", "The home schooling world grows bigger every year! This movie seems to have a dark side I didn't know about. I mean, other than the dead parent. Disney hates parents - especially mothers! :-)", "I know, it does seem that way. I had never heard of the fairy tale that this is based off of \"The Snow Queen\"", "I've heard of it, I think. Wasn't it a ballet?", "hmm, I don't know..", "OMG! This is really, really dark. I thought Hans was a good guy! I may actually want to see this movie now. In which case, my poor boy won't have a choice.", "It sounds like it has enough \"boy stuff\" in there to keep him interested.  Not a typical princess movie"]}

He plays a pretty good Alfred", "I think he gave a very convincing portayal of Bruce Wayne Michael Caine is one of my preferred actors. I've seen several of his films throughout the many years of his career", "He did Liam Neeson places Henri he was pretty good too I ddint realize Katie Holmes was even in this movie but she is says she played Rachel Dawes", "She was in the movie. I did not care for her acting.", "So Its a 2005 superhero movie that was a long time ago now I agree!! I do like Gary Oldman though he was good as James Gorden The movie was written by Nolan and David S Goyer.", "I thought the way Christopher Nolan brought us up to speed with how Bruce lost his parents was deeply powerful", "Yes, the movie tells the origin story of bruce wayne from the death of his parents to his journey to become batman", "It seemed as though the critics appreciated the darker side of this story", "His fight to stop Ra's al Ghui and the Scarecrow from plunging Gotham into chaos.", "I thought it was interesting how little the Scarecrow played a role in this film", "It was a comfotable mix it was.  14 years later Chill is freed in exchange for testifying against Gotham city male boss Carmine Falcone. Burce intends to murder him but one of Falcones assassins does so first.", "Liam Neeson definitely held his own on screen as both a mentor to Bruce and a zealot who went deep into his beliefs", "He did and did you know that as a child bruce wayne falls down into a dry well and is attacked by a swarm of bats so he has a phobia of bats now", "After watching this film, I felt strongly that Bale as Batman was an excellent choice", "Christman Bale played an excellent Batman in the story he learns the league intends to destroy gotham beleieving it to be corrupt", "Bruce turned the power of fear that Falcone used back on him"]}

{"conversation": ["Hello!", "Hello!", "Have you heard about The Post directed by Spielberg?", "I have just seen some of the trailer information. It looks very interesting.", "Yes, nothing brings more expectations than to know the main characters are play by Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep. Great actors for sure.", "I agree I can't wait to see how Tom brings to life the character Ben. Sarah Paulson is a good one too I would love to see how they bring the 70's back.", "Surely, a historical and political drama is always an excitement if the movie is well done! The trama promises a lot, set in the 70s and the difficult choices that were made in regards to publish documents relating the U.S. with Vietnam War", "Yes I bet those choices would be hard to make. The character had to be brave to do so. Being it is a true story that makes it even more appealing to me", "Yeah, that is a big plus to me too.", "I bet the Ellsberg was scared when he leaked the documents. How brave to do the right thing", "I think it would be interesting to see how a person involved in the war is affected by it and decides to make a move to create conscience between the American citizens.", "Yes I agree and how Meryl can depict the first female publisher. That would be interesting to see the dynamic of how it effected her career as well", "Yes, for a woman to have a successful career in those times was not an easy task, for sure.", "No not at all. They picked a strong woman to play the character. And having Tom as the executive editor to back her up. the dynamic between them must be amazing From the description of the movie I would have expected a higher rating from Rotten tomatoes", "Certainly! and about the rating at least is quite good, not as good as it should be perhaps.", "I would think that it would be in the high 90's with the casting", "Yeah, however this kind of movie has it more difficult to rate that higher because its audience target is smaller.", "That is true. It is a pitty that is the case. Historical movies should be higher than some of the other genres"]}
