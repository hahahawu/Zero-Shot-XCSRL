What I don't get is why Batman would agree to help Luthor after learning that he's associated with a weapons trafficker. What the heck, dude How rare can Kryptonite even bee if it's found in the Indian ocean? yeah, and if you have a Kryptonian scout ship, why not just use one of the Russian weapons with kryptonite on the tip to blast the big guy out of the sky? I'm sure Wonder Woman probably knows all the answers to that riddle. and why Luthor wants to get his grubby hands on General Zod's body. Sounds like a weird lounge display

What did you think of Ryan Gosling as Noah Calhoun? It is narated by an elderly man He was great
Yes, they were really good. What did you think of the scene at the beginning, when Loki shows up? That was a good lead in to the ensuing plot. Yes, and there is a lot of action with them taking the Tesseract and controlling Hawkeye. I wish I knew more about the characters' back stories prior to seeing the film. Well, it is the sixth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, so you should go back and watch the other five if you're curious. That is true. I am sure that if I watched the Thor movies, I would have a better understanding.  I've only seen the Ironman and Captain America movies.  Which ones have you seen?

Hey have you seen The Avengers? Yes, I have seen The Avengers. Did you like it? Have you seen it? Yes, i did actually. Yes it's great! Did you think this film got the critical rating it deserved? Not really. Why was that? Did you not like the actors in it or possibly the story? Or just simply didn't think it was as good as the other  Marvel Movies? I am a huge Marvel fan.  I didn't like when Captain America and Iron Man fought.  I know it happened in the comics also, but that was the big drawback for me. Really? Why was that particular scene a drawback? I personally liked that it took Thor to stop them (more or less). Did you like Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk? I didn't like the division of the Avengers .  I guess that is what bothered me most. He has grown on me.  It took a minute for me to get used to him as Hulk. I liked the scene when he transforms and falls from the carrier and surprises Harry Dean Stanton in a cameo who asks if he needs pants! What was your favorite Hulk part in the Avengers?
Hello there. Have you seen the movie The Blind Side? No I didn't. What is it about? The Blind Side is a great film, in my opinion. It is a film written and directed by John Lee Hancock and it is actually based on a book. The storyline features Michael Oher who is an offensive lineman who was drafted by the Baltimore Ravens of the NFL. This movie follows Michael from his impoverished upbringing through his years in school and his adoption by Seand and Leigh Anne Tuohy. That sounds interesting. Do you know where can I see this movie?
llo , how are you today ?
I am sure it would be a great film to watch one reviewer said its like of like 2 grown men wacking two dolls together, this was done on purpose rotton tomatos only gave it 27% so i dont think they were onboard with it Im sure it was, it would create more action in the film and more controversy Well the film is not for everyone but i am sure it is great better than man of steel it says, but not as good as Nolans "The Dark Knight" batman reboot Oh that was a good film, i remember that one I hope this one is the same metacritic gave this a 44/100 and a cenama score of B They are being very harsh with the score really, a star like Ben Afflec would not be in a film that bad i suppose that bruce wayne saw superman as an unchecked threat of power and decided that someonething should be done to curb him Well it is basically money versus super powers so depending on what bruce wayne can get it would be difficult for him batman still had some heart in him though as he saved supermans mom after superman said save Marta superman happened to be exposing bruce wayne in daily planet articles Well im sure they will have to work together at some point as they are both super heroes after supermans death luthor was gloating at superman from prison that now the world will be percieved as non safe
oh , you like the colder weather ? i love it . i love the snow and the cold . winter is my favorite season . you ? i think mine would be summer , course , this summer was really awesome . . yeah , it was great . i do also like driving with my windows down during the summer . well , i got a girlfriend this summer , so that was awesome . so yeah , summer rules hat is great ! good for you . hanks ! so , what do you do for a living ? i am still in school . . cannot stand it

I really liked it and the story was also great. Did you see it? yeah I think it has a great message about friendship and caring about people even if they are different than you even though its a kids movie I think its great for adults too Yes, I watched it as a teen and as an adult. What rating did it get from critics? when i first saw the movie i thought my toys could talk so i would always try to surprise them 100% on rotten tomatoes 95/100 on metracritic and a in cinema score i agree with the ratings and think it is one of the best animated movies ever made I agree with them as well, it's well deserved. Who released it? the director is john lasseter it is a disney pixar movie who is your favorite character? Disney, I am surprised. really? Lightyear Lightbuzz I forget the name buzz lightyear kind of the highlight of the first movei movie* have you seen the second and third movies?
hen open it up yeah

I think so! Even though it has a pretty average Rotten Tomato score but it is by Martin Scorsese who is well respected i will read about it It's really long but the acting is amazing and the story is really fact paced ok it's great thisI have not seenhow many times have you seen this movie I've probably seen it like 4 or 5 times. I like the movies Leonardo DiCaprio and Scorsese do together so it was right up my alley. Does it seem like a movie you would like? I'm seeing that it's based on some memories this is interesting I would like to see this movie, within which genre is classified I think it's considered a black comedy There is a lot of corruption and stealing from people this is excelllent Is this movie fun? yes it has jonah hill who is really funny and the whole movie is kind of making fun of these people this seems pretty entertaining I'm reading that this is about an investment agent in the stock market and there the story is centered hello are you here? in this moment

What do you think about Vector being trapped into the orbit? do you find it fair? was he really a bad human being? human beging*? From what it says I suppose he was. Fair I don't believe so but I guess this movie is all about judging. I agree with you! its all about judging sadly
wesome . my friend invited me a party . i will dance all night .
I can see that. Your right. The massive set pieces were dazzling. Did you like the pontoon set? It was amazing how non manufactured everything appeared. Yes it was amazing. What did you think of Tommy and Gibson working together to help the wounded man? They were great together, but horrible they couldn't be taken by the boat too. I liked the element of humanity the scene added to the film. Absolutely, it is nice to be able to connect like that to a piece. Gibson, even though he is a French soldier, still helps them. I know, it is nice to see there is always some good out there.

yeah it is very difficult do y ou like to watch tv
Oh, do you generally not watch "badly" rated movies? The fact that it's memorable enough to still be popular today is impressive. I'm more of a literature person. I like movies that have artistic goals more in line with that of a serious writer, not of someone paid to churn out scripts. In other words, I'm pretentious ya know

Yes, he is very funny and good at physical humor, slapstick. How many films has Morgan played God? The Rotten Tamatoes score is awful it kind of makes me lose faith in it He is the voice of God to me. idk thats a great question I never trust Rotten Tomatoes. Ive never really looked Never get into a work relationship, right? Always dangerous territory Has such a great cast Steve Carell was amazing. That scene where he is babbling was hilarious. Hes so incredibly talented Such a great plot. How many times has everyone imagined themselves being god And trying to answer the prayers. Shows how hard it is really Brings a human aspect to God You can't please them all though. Maybe the message was be nicer to god He abused his powers to be with the girl he loved feels like cheating Just be happy with what you have. But you dont always get a happy ending. the happy ending is realizing you were happy the whole time
ow that sounds like a lot of fun ! i spend time with my many friends too . one actually taught me how to drive .
Yeah, great director by Joss Whedon Cool. I have seen some of his movies and they were good. Is this one similar to ones he has made in the past?

country . luke bryan is my favorite . i adore charlie daniels ! that is so nice they can roam freely !
I haven't seen it since I was a kid. Back then it seemed like a hilarious movie. Today, though, I dont know how I'd respond to it. I think thats kind of what happens with most movies we loved as kids Some remain great though. Like some of the old Pixar films. The kid must have been some kind of little engineer to set up all those traps too Haha. well they did a good job of mixing in stuff for adults to laugh at too I remember watching a video where some military people examined the traps, and some were actually lethal. Like the bucket on the stairs. Yea I think the fire one would probably mess you up pretty good too And the whole idea of just forgetting one of your kids. I mean seriously Well, to be fair, it was a big family. I have 3 kids  and I don't think I could leave any of them behind I have four siblings, and we were always getting lost in walmarts and such. I can't remember how many they had but I mean seriously getting lost in wal mart and boarding a plane without them is 2 different things lol I suppose you're right. :) Looking back now, I think the movie was pretty meh. Yea it still has some charming moments and the like littel bit with john candy and the polka band is pretty funny i live in a huge polka town right now Only the ending action was interesting to me, with the traps and the burglars and all. You do? and man that bit cracks me up lol yea Polka as in the musical genre? Honestly, I don't even recall a polka scene. Its not so much a scene with them playing polka but like John candy drives his mom back to chicago in a avn with a polka band
what you get from a male
right. he really needs to be something special if he's going to be the lead who do you think should have gotten that lead role?

Yeah, it will be more of the document. I believe 2 more "rounds" of this document. So now we can see the cast/intro stuff. My page looks the same tho lol usually it's more stuff. I also see a "key scene" bit.  I forgot about the going "savage" bit of the movie. I don't think I knew that Jason Bateman was the voice of the fox. OH yeah. the savage part. I always forget about that part, its a little dark to see, but my kids didn't think much of it. My favorite part was probably the sloth part. It helps me not to know the voice actor.  that takes me out of the movie when i recognize the celebrity that's a good point!  I kind of dont like knowing either. My document advanced yeah, new scene added.  the asylum bit is mentioned.  another dark element.
i watch movies more than i read i got into the habit in the hospital . had two toes amputated in an accident .

I hate sad endings. i did not want to spoil anything , but sure you will not  be disapointed, it was delightful so you would recommend it then? yes definitely i would reccomend Nice, are there any other movies that it is similar to? i cant think of any ,so far this is the one for me is the acting good? Gosling and  specially Mcadams give all star performance, left the audience with touching scenes

I have not, please tell me a little about the movie? It's an animated Pixar type film about a villain who winds up with a soft heart. Whom was the main character? Do you like animated films? The main villain who is also the protaganist is Gru Animated films yes I love them. With the voice of Steve Carell What was your favorite part of the move? movie? Personally, my favorite part are the Minions, which are these little yellow critters that are Gru's, well, minions Do they have different names? The main plot is that Gru wants to steal the moon. Not really. But I think a few of them have names Jason Sefel plays Victor Perkins, Gur's archenemy. Why do they steal the moon? To be the greatest villain ever of course! In the meantime, Gru adopts 3 little girls to use them to get to Perkins What Perkins? Gru's archenemy I mentioned him just before you asked about the moon Using the little girls he gains access to Victor's fort to steal a shrink ray So that he can shrink the moon and steal it. This seems like a great movie! What else can you tell me about it? It is. It's really cute. But still entertaining for adults. How long is the movie?
derstandable . trying to find someone to go shopping for me i am scared since the hostage crisis i am scared too ! we can face our fears together .
i teach it in my class . do you enjoy horror movies ? i do .
ll i just got off duty as well whats that odds of this happening . do not tell me you work at a factory ? i work as a security guard in the mall
Yeah. It is a bunch of new actors in it. The story is set in 1962 and is about a mute custodian at a government laboratory who falls in love with a humanoid amphibian creature that the laboratory captured. Kinda sounds like scifi wow does sound like a weird movie to me so what else happens?
hi ! i am having dinner . . . a slice of chocolate cake with extra vanilla cream
zania you , oh how i would love to go but i am 103 i wish , its tooroo expensive ll 103 ! ! that is beautiful ! ! ! ll
i AGREE ? I hope not. 1 was enough hahaha I'm pretty sure they made multiple ones haven't seen any of them though I have seen 2 sadly. Do you have kids? No but I have a few young nieces so I get to watch movies with them occasionally How to Train your dragon is my favorite of all time Haven't seen that one.  Moana is very good. Oh I liked Moana also!  I highly recommend How to Train your Dragon! I am obviously biased but still I like old cartoons the most. Have you seen Mickey and beanstalk?
Although one of my favorite parts of the movie is when they go to the theme park, so adorable1 Yes I lobe those scenes they are so fun and keep me engaged I think it is hilarious when the moon goes back to its original size in Vectors ship and forces him to be stuck on the moon but they get kidnapped by Vector hpw scary
it's sad that aurora had a curse on her and couldn't undo it Yeah but that had to be kept from the original story from the brothers Grim yeah that makes sense i liked how the raven was able to change forms what did you think about that Yeah , he was my favorite character, when he was changed into a dragon was fantastic oh i didn't read about that part what happened? When the king traped her in an iron net her last resort was to turn the crow into a dragon to fight off the knights that's rude of the king! haha yes it was at least stefan was finally killed
lways go for chocolate with peanut butter if possible ! yes but too much ice cream not good for my marathon prep . do you run ?
Indeed.  I loved Matthew McConaughey as Mark Hana.  He was perfect as sleazy Wall Street type. Sex and drugs fueled stockbroker culture.. yeah that's intense. I like how it reads "the only job is to make money for himself" For sure, some of the party scenes were out of this world for sure. Right, and that is exactly how he acted. That's pretty much how he made so much money so quickly. Well.. you know.. I always wondered why the title of the film is "The Wolf of Wall Street" Oh yeah so a scam Stratton Oakmont haha
i do not get to travel often , but if so that sounds wonderful !
I know haha And I actually didn't know that Have you read the book? No , I too just found out You remember the opening scene? Did you watch the movie in the theaters? omg no I wasn't born yet you? Same here haha. I watched it home with my mom I was so scared But I ended up really liking it yeah , it works the shark is only for a short amount of time I love how they never really show the shark itself. Well, they do, but only for like a few times yeah! but the tension is through out the movie the shark hunter quotes a bounty of 10k for killing it It's the music that's why haha ends up dying poor bastard How long ago did you watch the movie? like 4-5 years ago I watched it as a kid but didn't remember much of it but when I saw it recently wow a mastah peace The boat on which they hunt the whale is named Orca Have you gone to the Universals Studio tour? They talk a lot about Jaws That's funny Orca omg they are known to hunt great whites It's brilliant the small details I don't live in US so never had the chance what about you? I just went last week I have a pass that's awesome But the tour guide was talking a lot about it what other things are there? they have a mechanical shark there , right? And how the suspense is created by the music itself Yes you are absolutely right about the music thing And it eats like a  human dummy in the water haha one of the most iconic music ever haha
o but i would love to go ! he people are so nice and the food is amazing ! utah is not far ! well lets plan to go ! sounds good . i just cant eat seafood , yuck . do you like seafood ?

do you see g h o s t s
i also like coming up with new hairstyles . i guess i am just girly . i like playing minecraft most of my time . ver played it . not big in playing video games . anything else about you ?
I like Jim Carrey, but Morgan Freeman was who really won me over He is consistently a pleasure to watch. Do you normally watch comedy movies, or do you typically go for a different genre? My favorite genre is horror, but comedy is a close second.
y daughters took an acting class . my sons did not want to . what city are you from ?
hi know of any good movies? It looks like "Batman Begins" is a good one. cool who's in it? It stars Christian Bale, Michael Caine and Liam Neeson. which one is batman? Christian Bale. I don't think I know him Love Liam though Yes, he's the villain. Caine's in everything Liam as a bad guy! awesome! I'm there! Yes, very exciting! something undefinably cool about the Liam who directed it? He's a terrifically good actor.  It was directed by Christopher Nolan. hmm don't know that name was the movie a critical success? Yes it was. who plays his girlfriend the da It looks like Katie Holmes. whoa cool she's underrated Yes, very entertaining.  I haven't really seen much of her. It's hard to watch her without Dawson or a Creek coming to mind I never saw Dawson Creek, so I'm in the dark. not missin gmuch Oh, good. what year is the movie 2005 What did rotten tomatoes give it? 84% and average 7.7/10 that's pretty high sounds pretty much like a must-see Is it?  CinemaScore gave it an A. I'd see it just for Liam
2pac is my man . californiaaaa love ! ok , what is your hobbies ?
he wanted to much money The scene where Stane took the reactor out of Stark's chest was a great scene. I wonder where they filmed the Afghanistan scenes?  I know it wasn't really Afghanistan, but it looked like it could be. I doubt it I think it was probably like arizona or something in southern cali there is alot of desert areas out there Yeah, that sounds about right.
sure , we know each other pretty well . he is a great father ! ine is a deadbeat you are lucky
i work on railroads . what about you ?
lol. Well John Wick is the kind of fired-up , ferocious b-movie some action people love Yes I do
It's a good movie It was a loooong time ago, and I'm not 100% I got to see the whole thing. I remember liking what I saw though. It stars Anjelina Jolie
so what are your hobbies . i like playing sports . i like to swim , read books ice . i like to socialize . i love chatting with my friends . oo got a coffee club i attend most weeks re you good at holding conversations ? yes , i have a knack for speaking writing texting me too . i can talk to people with ease . are you in a relationship ?
That is a good point. I never really thought about that before.  I think it is nice to see him as a human and then superhero Maybe he would have taken a different course had they not been murdered.  I like how they use all different emotions to really make the movie great yea i know
king wedding plans . getting married soon . oh wow ! where is the wedding going to be ? we will be wed in a park . unfortunately , my family will not be there . i work at a real estate law firm ! i know nice wedding places we are going to niagra falls . are you married ? i am not but i want to marry . i am a lesbian and i enjoy female authors . do you have pets ? i have a dog . he is ring bearer . i have a fish , but i do not think it can be ring bearer probably not . do you have family ? my brother , but not one of my own . do you ?
yes im still here yes it stars mcauley culkin The main character is left behind while his family flies to France. yes it is a great comedy yes of the breakfast club fame and ferris bueller right im not familiar with chris columbus though During that time, the main character has to protect the house from 2 burglars. yes i said that right I am also not familiar with him i am familiar with him What other movies has he directed? chris columbus not sure who he is. john hughes directed alot of movies. " pretty in pink" I love the scenes when 'Kevin" plays tricks on the burglars Oh i see he plays many tricks like the road runner cartoon DO you like comedies? i like some yes yes i remember joe pesci. i forgot daniel stem Rotten Tomaties gave ut 62% 5.5/10, Metacritic gave it 63/100 and cinemascore   gave it A do you agree with score
I mean it received an A from CinemaScore. well thats better did you watch it The movie is about Maleficent's relationship with the princess and king. oh ok not that interesting sounding Well, I am surprised by the fact that it was a Super Hero Genre that doesnt make sense should be fairytale She is a decent being since she cares for a younger fairy at the time. Yea, exactly!!!!! oh i see. thats some fake news
hat is good that she is learning how to swim . its important . yes . i wanted to make sure she was not afraid of the water since so many people are . i am one . i am doing the same with my son . he is like a fish on water . hat is awesome . now i cannot keep my daughter out of the pool . swimming is good for everyone . my veteran grandpa loves his heated pool .

rfield and i have a lot in common , as we both detest mondays .
lol , that is cool . are you familiar with the red wedding in got ? i know it . but i think it is the earlier nice one . most got weddings someone gets killed , lol . but not all . yeah ? i guess i have not seen enough . but people do like the ethos . did you ever watch walking dead ? i did see a bit of that . weddings on that show ? one wedding i think . glen and the farmers daughter got married . oh well maybe i should expect some requests about that to . ot really . that wedding was several seasons ago . do not worry ! oh ok . which season ?
yes with its cast and director, and a great moving story line it should have gotten a much higher rating
i you doing today hi there i just came in from hiking , hbu ? well i am stuck , no technology , just being savage i am well a little down me an my mom use to do it together hat is something i never heard how come ? conserving energy ? whats going on ok , well due to remoteness , , i feel trapped my mom passed away , in my spare time i write about fiction , i am sorry to hear that , writing is cool to do well how are you talking to me without any ? weird . anyway , i am in advertstiment sing my mind , and telepathic powers
oh delicious , sounds like something my husband would hate ! cool ! does your husband like to read ? i love to . yes he does ! he reads and i sew . its kind of my passion , opened a little shop .
Oh yes. I do wonder how they communicate.... Good question! "ET go hooooome!!!" Lol OK, we have lots of back and forth. Shall we "Finish Conversation"? Or is there some rule?
I agree. I also loved Michael Caine's performance too. The only character I didn't care for was Rachel, but that is a small gripe. Not a KatieHolmes fan? I thought she was OK. I think Batman needed a reboot from its previous episodes, how about you? I think she did fine, I just felt like the relationship didn't feel authentic. And I agree, something modern was definitely needed for Batman Do you like Superhero movies? I enjoyed the journey of Bruce Wayne to Batman. ... I like some of them. How about you? That's interesting. I think Nolan's vision did a great job at uniting both comic book fans and those that aren't too into the genre. I personally love superhero movies. That scene was overall brutal to watch. I can't blame Bruce for the phobia. Ha ... Do you think the critics werefairto the movie? I think it was a little underrated. I think it should deserve a little more praise when compared to its peers. How did you like the scene when he fell in the well? Scared me a lot. It's an uncomfortable scene I don;t like tight spaces
you wanted an affair ? i love my man o , i misunderstood your request for friendship . i am glad you have love yes i do lol are you married ?
Ok, nice talking to you.
Cool. Then you don't follow. I liked ZZ Top. Saw them at an outdoor concert in GA long ago. Music back then was so much better than the stuff nowadays. I was looking through the notes and apparently they did split up in the movie and met again at a party some months later. Yea, I'm still getting used to today's music but half the time I don't understand what they are saying. That's interesting. Fate intervened. What's meant to be will happen no matter what. Can't force romance. If it happens, it happens. Higher power at work.
yeah you should definitely listen to him sometime i will try to fit it in when i am gardening i saw some guy gardening and gave him a long stare from afar
Joss Whedon ok, thank u LET'S KNOW SOMEMORE ABOUT THIS MOVIE HI ARE YOU THER HELLLO its is blockbuster movie YES I HAVE SEEN THIS MOVIE ABOUT MORE THAN 10 TIMES yes definitely i will watch this movie I LIKE THIS MOVIE THAT MOVIE OH OK last 30 mins to very nice my friend told ok, bye

i am in colorado so i am great ! hat is nice what do you do for living
I don't know. I've seen a couple of these that didn't make sense now. I think Bullock had great performances and perhaps won awards. Yes, her performance has been widely regarded. I think maybe some people were disappointed with some other performances in the film, but I am unsure. Hard to believe this came out almost 10 years ago now. I had forgotten the tension about the kids being around him in the film. He really did have a tough time. I suspect the part about him not taking to football were embellishments. I bet he could play from the first time he stepped on the field. So true, such a touching story. I enjoyed the depiction of Mike and his protective instincts and how he was made to be a lineman based on that. I concur, I think he was naturally talented.
what ? ! ? no ! yes ! i have seen many ghosts in my lifetime . i believe in shots but that does not mean my son is a demon .
it is a bit chilly but nice . do you play many games ?
I'm more fond of action movies. But this picture also has some interesting scenes. Do you agree with the rating of the movie? 96% on rotten tomatoes and 95/100 on metacritic seem a bit high What would you give it? I would rate it in the 80's range I would agree with that. It was definitely a good portrayal of the story, but nothing exceptional. there are however some good individual performances what did you think of Jesse Eisenberg as Zuckerberg? I thought he did a pretty decent job. That's why I thought Mark Zuckerberg must've been involved in the project in order to see things from his viewpoint. You think he risks being typecasted? can only play "zuckerberg" types in the future?
i have family in kentucky . love it there .

The movie starts with Stark and his military liaison Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes demonstrating the " Jericho missile in Afghanistan. When the demo is finished Starks convoy is ambushed and Stark becomes critically wounded by his own company's grenades.  He is captured and imprisoned by a terrorist group. A fellow captive who is a doctor implants an electromagnet into Stark's chest to keep the shrapnel shards from reaching his heart and killing him. The leader of the group promises freedom if Stark recreates the Jericho missile but the prisoners are skeptical Does the whole movie take place in Afghanistan? No, Stark returns to the US. How is the music in the movie? I have no information on who the music is compiled by or which artists were involved in the film. What did you think of the movie? I think i was good movie. Lots of action scenes, a believable villain, and the love interest didn't over take the movie. Do you think it is appropriate for kids? I think it could be depending on the age group. There is some violence and death as well as sexual suggestion, but it isn't super gory.

I felt very shock on that moments., Ahh.., Then how you feel about that moment ? As an ex-hitman I bet he was a large target for many different people. no need to bet .. yes you right said. I wonder why only Chad Stahelski was credited as directing the film and they didn't include Leitch? think he may need full credit.. what you feel ? It says they both directed it together but only one of them got credit for it, that seems unfair to me. no may be leitch not like to mention name on that I see that John Wick got the nickname "Baba Yaga", I wonder what the meaning of that name is and how he came into it. What do you think? Yoga is the mean of exercise for health including mind.. May be in India there is a person who named baba yoga. so he used this name It says Yaga, not Yoga. I wonder what Yaga means? oh sorry. That's okay. i thought it yoga yaga is also traditional thing it is a part of Hinduism. like prayer It was awesome that Aurelio punched Losef because he brought him John's stolen car. I think it's nice that he had his back and told John about him coming to the shop with his stolen car. also he travels to the little russia church. I would not want to go in the Red Circle and try to get Losef back, that would be scary to have to fight all those people. That also explains why he had to retreat back to his hotel to take care of all of his injuries.
They did a good job at making them super cute yet super funny as well. Their light-hearted cuteness might have made it a little hard for the movie to get to my emotions more at the heartfelt scenes. I think it was just a tiny bit more for kids than for families/everyone like some other animated movies have been.
hi! I'm reading the document Wow, the reception for this movie was pretty bad. Do you agree that when you watch a literary movie, that it's best to put aside the book?
yes ! i love to blast metal while riding my harley . i bet that is a lot of fun . i love all types of music re you a professional musician ? o but that would be nice one day . i do not play any instruments ither . bikes and hikes are for me . do you work ? i do not . i just spend a lot of time enjoying life
I think it was a good ending, the puppy was very similar in circumstances to himself Plus I have a soft spot for bully breeds. :) I agree! I love dogs. What do you think about the actor who played Viggo?
yes i will be getting marked next tuesday org , that is fantastic ! ! congratulations ! ! hanks do you have kids fortunately , no i do not . i do however have two small dogs , peanut and jelly . wwww that is cute do you want kids yes , i really do . we would have to adopt though .
I completely understand that,. It would be interesting if it was someone funny.  They put 2 male comic actors together but usually not a male and female. Now I would like the powers that Jim Carrey had in the movie The restaurant scene was really funny, I liked that the voices kept getting in the way.
i would love a fine dining steak and seafood place . very cool , i love seafood . do you have any other hobbies ? i hike , read , craft . what about you ? i love tennis , going to concerts , and watching movies i have not played tennis in years but i used to love it . it is great . i play all the time . i love playing on green grass

hello, what is the name of the movie? The Avengers 2012 Oh, cool!! is this an action movie? yeah.. its about american superheroes film based on the marvel comics Awesome, what superheroes are the ones played in the movie? its the sixth film in the marvel cinematic universe Nice, how long is it? iron man, captain america, hulk, thor, etc That's cool! its metacritic score: 69/100 Interesting, what is the name of the actors who played the thor roll? actor* Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark / Iron Man Chris Evans as Steve Rogers / Captain America Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner / Hulk Chris Hemsworth as Thor, the crown prince of Asgard. Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow Jeremy Renner as Clint Barton / Hawkeye Good names! seems like an really good movie! Who is the director of this movie? Joss Whedon Ok, I Haven't watch this movie yet but looks interesting. does this movie has a second part? You know.. in the story the avengers become devided.. finally good avengers won information not provided about second part Ohh I understand. are the special effects in this movie good? yes.. in avenger's movie its common. the scenes are aweson That's good to hear, I like scarlett as an actress  so I definitely will be watching this movie! Who are the enemies in the movie?
Like, in one scene, he decides to change his girlfriend's boob sizes to be bigger. I don't know if that is quite appropriate He also uses his powers as God to blow a girls skirt up. I can't think of any other inappropriate/sexual things in it. It is just a slap-stick comedy for sure. ah ok probably not a good idea to watch it with kids. I guess its a religious movie? since it is about God? Not really, just basically like, His job is hard. Like, at one scene, Carrey keeps hearing voices. And it is explained that he hasn't been answering prayers. So he instead organizes these requests by sorting them into an email. So he starts answering them, and gets  a bit overwhelmed. So then he just replies "yes" to everyone. So then a bunch of people win the lottery at the same time. He hasn't been answering prayers? God or Carrey? Carrey He was just playing with the new given powers. Interesting.

I am doing good, I didn't get a document, did you get a movie to talk about? we will be talking about batman begins Oh, that is one of my favorite superhero movies! it was christopher nolan as the director yes it is a darker take He is good in everything in directs. yes christain cale was a great bruce wayne it had good scores from critics What kind of scores did it get? it had a 84 on rotten tomatos Is that out of 100? yes it starts off when bruce was a child I remember that, doesn't have a scene where he's terrorized by bats in a well? he fell into a well and was scared by the bats yes then it goes over his parents death Oh yes, and then does it mean to away to some martial arts sanctuary in some other country. when the mugger joe chill killed jis parents yes and he trains i think I think I remember Cillian Murphy in it as the scarecrow? yes it was weird when bruce tried to burn a temple down but the guys he was training with was evil i say that this was a great super hero movie Now that you bring that up I remember it, his mentor who is the evil guy that wanted to destroy Gotham. yep he was kill by some debris when the temple fell I actually own this movie, so I think I might have to watch it tonight after talking about it. yes i would like to see it again myself Doesn't Liam Neeson play the bad guy? yes he does
Yes, I love Don Rickles as the voice of Mr. Potato Head! Who is your favorite character? Tom Hanks is a fantastic actor, he was a great choice for woody. Yes, Tom Hanks was great as Woody! I also liked Tim Allen as Buzz Lightyear. They pair very well together also. It is so impressive that Toy Story was the first feature length computer animated movie! I know Pixar is amaxing, they did a great job with John Lasseter directing. The premise of talking toys is great oo. too. And that cast of writers! Joss Whedon- I had no idea he was part of that Or that Steve Jobs was a producer Oh my- the talking toys are so brilliant. An entirely different but so familiar world The entire cast is amazing, I had no idea Steve Jobs produced the film. Yes, I loved the fact that the toys wanted Andy to like them so much, a new twist. yes, and the connection between andy and woody was so sweet

me too.  it is a fun christmas movie.  critics can be so mean. Joe Pesci and Daniel  Stern were hilarious in it, and Macaulay Culkin. Joe Pesci always makes a movie fun to watch.  Whatever happened to Macaulay Culkin? A critic response was "Flat and unsuprising." That movie is full of suprises. I'm not sure after the Home Alone series. The director for the movie was Chris Columbus, and it came out in 1990. Seriously?  that's crazy.  Now I feel old. I think we should rent Home Alone and watch it again.  even if there's no surprises left. I thought it was a crazy concept of a movie, but loved it. Everyone should love a good "Kid outsmarts the baddies" movie. Yes, they should. What was your favorite booby trap that Kevin did to the burglars? Definitely the iron in the face.  hahaha.  laugh just thinking about it. That's a good one. lol David Stern and Joe Pesci make the best faces. how about yourself? oooo, also liked the tarantula face he made.  awesome. When the boy made the floor slippery, and they flew all over the place.
what is your favorite movie ? well i just became a widow two months ago . odfather , love it . sorry to hear . losing someone is the reason i weigh so much . he was too young . i am taking some time for me but i am social . hat is healthy . most people cannot handle losing the love of their life that way . he was too young . i am taking some time for me but i am social . whoops , did you mean to say that again ? he was too young . i am taking some time for me but i am social . i think somethings wrong with our chat huh ?
DVD, what did you think? I saw it in the theater, I had high expectation for it, but I was a bit unsure since it was a new batman cast.  Did you read the comic or watch the cartoon? I did! Loved the comic but was very disappointed by the movie. Seems consistent with what the reviews of the movie are. Do you agree? I agree, they really hyped it up to be a huge fight and I thought it was anti climactic.  On the upside, they had some great acting, but it still will never be on par with Christopher Nolan's trilogy
o i went to different schools in several states . you ? i was homeschooled . it was awkward you know what is awkward ? my cat kj do you care about kj though ? i do , i even cook for her i also deeply love my pets what pets do you have ? so many that i have lost count when i was a nurse people brought in pets .

Hopefully the sequel shud come soon

Time is also distorted when entering the dream world I believe the main character enters the dreamworld to be with his family? i'm not too sure to be honest Distorted how, like is it longer compared to the real world or shorter? yup, several hours in the real world can be decades in the dream worlds as you get into dreams within dreams Is his family trapped in a dream or something? i think they're dead i'm not fully sure

That's not bad. Better than a D true. I can see why older people may not like the movie.
Yes I have! It was great! I thought so, too! Highly recommend it - and it loks like other do as well. Rotten Tomatoes rates it at 81% It was better than expected - thats for sure! The comedy, the references to pop-culture, and the heartwarming message were all great! I also really liked the concept - the Bad Guy is the central character. And wow does he steal the show! True life, the main people in your life aren't always the good guys True! And if there is anyone out there who isn't convinced that they should see this film - Steve Carell... that's all I have to say. He's great as Gru! He is a comedic genius! Anything he touches in entertainment is golden! You know, I never realized until tonight the Jason Segal was the 'arch nemesis' villin. That's funny. I really like him, too.

Oh that is a great score. Who else is in the movie? as well as good ratingson other review sites The film also stars Andrew Garfield, Justin Timberlake, and Armie Hammer When did it come out? It came out in 2010 October 1, 2010 to be exact The movie is actually based off a book of how Facebook was found Oh wow, a while ago. Is it appropriate for kids? Who wrote the book? The Accidental Billionaires by Ben Mezrich So the movie starts off with Zuckerberg, who at the time was at Harvard, being dumped by his gf He returns to his dorm to write an insulting post about her on his blog and then creates a website called Facemash by hacking in the college database ouch. he sounds kinda mean. is he supposed to be the good guy?
Lindsay Lohan plays Cady Heron and Rachel McAdams is Regina George. Oh wow, tell me about the plot, what happens?
In a world where toys are living things who pretend to be lifeless when humans are present,a group of toys, owned by six-year-old Andy Davis, are caught off-guard when Andy'sbirthday party is moved up a week, as Andy, his mother, and infant sister Molly, arepreparing to move the following week. The toys' leader and Andy's favorite toy, a pull-stringcowboy doll named Sheriff Woody, organizes the other toys, including Bo Peep theshepherdess, Mr. Potato Head, Rex the Dinosaur, Hamm the Piggy Bank, and Slinky Dog,into a scouting mission. Green army men, led by Sarge, spy on the party, and report theresults to the others via baby monitors. The toys are relieved when the party appears to endwith none of them having been replaced, but then Andy receives a surprise gift – anelectronic toy space ranger action figure named Buzz Lightyear, who thinks he is an actualspace ranger. I'd like to watch it, I think. When was it released? As a kid I remember it being a really fun movie since it keeps changing themes throughout the movie. Rotten Tomatoes scored it a 100% and averaging 9/10 from most critics. It was originally released in 1995. Okay, that's a great score.  I've never seen an RT score of 100% before. They're rare to come by, especially these days! I haven't seen the 3rd movie, but the 2nd was pretty memorable. Did it win any awards? It was awarded a few notable ones, but not as many as it was nominated for, unfortunately. What is, unfortunate. How long is it?  I'll need to block off some time in my schedule to see it. It's unfortunate that the movie was nominated for more awards than it actually won. How long is the movie?
Totally agree.I think it also showed that things aren't always what they seem - and that people often have ulterior motives and hidden skills. Strong female police officers aren't exactly being shown in every single movie about LEO. yeah I feel that it's super awesome that they had that "you don't have to fit into some's box in order to follow your dreams" theme Agreed. It's a good introduction to the way that things can be complex! it's also really interesting to me that movies have changed so much since i was little. I grew up with things like Fox and the Hound and A Bug's Life, and now they're making socially relevant movies for toddlers. Absolutely! I feel like it is going to end up being a really under rated movie, which makes me sad haha. It's well written, the cast is stellar and the message is solid. I think it's awesome that Disney doesn't under cut children and dumb things down cause "they're kids and wont understand"

Yes, definitely.  It is a classic, but still very action packed even for today. I don't know much about it.. can you refresh me? It is about an extremely large great white shark that is way too close to a vacation beach. That sounds terrifying! A marine biologist and the police try to hunt it before it hurts anyone else. The first scene is legendary when a woman is dragged under by Jaws. Well i DON'T KNOW IT BUT SOUNDS ENTERTAINING. opps sorry for the caps,lol Anyone famous in it? No problem.  Yes, some of it's best scenes are just suspense where you don't even see the shark. I feel on edge just thinking about it. Roy Schneider and Richard Dreyfuss are in it.  The characters seem very real. Steven Spielberg directed it and it is very well done. I really lke Richard Dreyfuss. Oh wow.

I see this film was highly rated on rotten tomatoes with a 98% I see that.  Rotten Tomatoes is relatively reliable so it must be good The movie is about a rabbit who is a cop Yes, I thought the plot was pretty creative. Do you typically like watching animated movies? Yes I watch too may because I have small children I agree with the response that it is funny, smart and thought provoking That is not usual for animated movies That is a good description of this film What did you think of the voice acting I know some of those names like Jason Bateman and Idris Elba, but don't recognize many others I only recognize Jason Bateman I am surprised it was made in 2016 I thought it was a much older movie I agree.  I would of thought it was from 2015 or so. I wonder if Byron Howard and Rich Moore have done any other films. I'm sure.  It's a google search later. The night howlers diversion in the film was clever I read somewhere that night howlers are actually real. I wouldn't doubt it. They are some type of poisonous flower I liked the Fox characters overall story.  Being a con artist and being a bullied child.  Really rich character The movie models much of what kids face today...bullying, insecurities etc. defintely Thats a good point.  Kids can relate to it I was a bit surprised by the ending Bellwether...the little lamb nice diversion Gun with blueberries...i mean a gun is gun regardless of what you put in it Ya, the movie lead you to believe otherwise The way they adapted the real world into the animal world was pretty amazing very creative I guess it's the theme...don't judge a book by it's cover That seems to be a popular theme. the fox is sweet, the lamb is the villian, the bunny is the strongest.  Played on stereotupes
WOW
better to shop there than work there . that is why i am going to college . y daughter worked there and did not like it

I disagree, I think it was great to have morgan freeman. he is in everything and feels a bit of a comment on that.I can't believe it came out in 2003, seems so long ago. Yeah, that was so long ago. What can you say about the director? Not much I am not sure what else he has done. I think the Tom Shadyac did a great job for directing this movie. I agree with you on that. Very highconcept comedy film and enjoyable. I love the effects they have on this movie. I enjoyed them as well. I also thought jeniffer aniston was good as grace.

Yeah, I didn't bother watching it. Did you? I did.  I don't agree with the critics.  I think it was a goofy fun superhero movie.  Are you a fan of the genre? Yes, I loved Black Panther. What made you want to see Batman V Superman? I'll pretty much see any big budget thing in theaters, not much to do in this small town.  But, I must say, mediocre performances from everyone, but Jesse Eisenberg did play a descent into madness pretty admirably. I like Ben Affleck as a director but I think he's a horrible Batman. Do you think they're going to make a sequel? I do think they're setting everything up - the justice league type thing, though I heard that didn't do great either.  I can't imagine Affleck is going to play Batman half as long as Christian Bale did though. I didn't catch Suicide Squad either. I think the last DC movie I saw was the last Nolan Batman. Why do you think DC has trouble compared to Marvel Studios? I think DC just is more concerned with getting big named actors (Affleck, Amy Adams, Jesse Eisenberg) than they are actually developing story.  Batman v. Superman felt kind of rushed, and even with the star power in the movie, it just didn't do enough for it critically.  Hiring already established actors for these roles is rough unless they are exceptional actors.

Jonah Hill is so funny. Sure. Are the reviews good for the movie? And Margot Robbie is so pretty! Well let's talk about the contents of the document you are given It is a very entertaining movie. It's somewhat of a black comedy. I didn't know, but it is based on a memoir. So tell me about Leo's character. What does he do in the movie? It tells a story of Jordan Belfort (DiCaprio) in his career as a stockbroker. Jonah Hill is his business partner, Donnie Azoff. I see. Do they start their own firm? or are they just a coworker? They get into some shady business dealings and the FBI tries to bring them down. Matthew McConaughey is in the movie too. He does a pretty impressive acting job in this movie, he useually comes across somewhat dingy, but He played his character intensely.

Are you fond of musicals in general? I am actually. It usually depends on the type of musical it is. That one particular song, Let it go, especially was over played I agree completely. For the longest time, I associated Kristen bell with only this movie Idena Menzel was who I associated it with. Oh, yeah, because of the song They were actually pretty well known before the movie, but had a different audience. It's amazing how much money they made on the merchandize It is still making money! Disney is milking it for all it's worth. True. I wonder if it will have a sequel I hope not. It will not be as good as the first. That is usually the case with most sequels. People expect a lot and then are disappointed Frozen had a few short films come out. They didn't receive well at all. Oh really, did know that The animation quality was good Yes it was. and each new movie keeps getting better. Was this a Pixar too? I don't think so. I think it was strictly Disney. This movie was released in 2013, it seems like yesterday!
I did not party like that but was into the party scene and drinking not so much the drugs. I know, Leo is an amazing actor. it received a 78% from rotten tomatoes, which I think is a pretty fair score Yea I never got into drugs like that. But it's fun to watch other people lol. Oh, I'm surprised, I thought it would have gotten higher. What was your most memorable scene from the movie?

The wormhole conveniently opened for Loki to reach Earth. Yes, and of course it was when Nick Fury happened to be near by. Avengers is predictable but the characters are fun and it has a great cast. I don't know that I would call that scene a key scene but then again if Loki never reached Earth, the movie couldn't have happened. I liked Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner. It was interesting that the group was divided on how to approach Loki. That is interesting and also fun when Thor attempts to stop the Hulk It was unfortunate that the physicist from the research facility was captured and controlled by Loki. That was unfortunate.  It all comes back to the wormhole.  Now it is used above Stark Tower to start his invasion. Yes. The wormhole allowed the Chitauri fleet to invade Earth.  That was a frightening scene, but the acting was stellar. Once they were motivated to work as a team, Loki didn't have a chance. I like that they worked together to save civilians.

i dont really care much for leo di caprio do you like crime movies? i love them ] most of all thrillers I like this one because its based on true story and I find it interesting that his crimes effect how we do banking today yes the fact that this happened gets my total attention the movie is 140 mins huh a little too long for my taste but if its good then its fine its a fast pace movie keeps you entertained the whole time the final scenes are a little dragged out oh hmm i read not such a good critics about it but ill give it a try I feel bad for Frank Jr when he finds out that his father died while in jail. When that happens he almost starts his check fraud again oh ok hey do u think we should end the chat its about to be 15 mins Sure ok well nice meeting u have a geat day

Yeah he's a bit nuts now.  I think that's what happens to child actors sometimes Are there any sequels? Yeah there are several but I think the original is the best onie Okay. HMM do you know if it is on Netlifx or Amazon?
it has got to be the classroom scene, without a doubt what's yours? When he comes in and pretends to be the substitute? That is a great scene. I think when Tom Hanks first catches him, and he acts like he's a federal agent from another division. He gets away scot-free yeah, that was brilliant Is this your favorite Leo Dicaprio movie? Thats a really tough question, Django was amazing but I'd probably go with Blood Diamond Luckily my parents never got a divorce and I never was forced to run away and con Pan Am out of 2.8 million. That was a good one XD I did not like the scene where his mom had an affair. My favorite Leo DiCaprio movie is Shutter Island, without a doubt, that's the greatest movie Leo Dicaprio has ever acted in That was a good one That was a tough 10 minutes of the movie when Frank Jr finds out his father died and then he goes to his mothers house to see her happy with a new family. Yes, that scene was really painful Did you think there was a possibility he wasn't going to show up after Carl let Frank fly, near the end of the movie? actually, and funnily enough XD I was so anxious while watching that scene I really thought he wasn't gonna show up

Oh so they're not the same. Ok. At least the reviews are decent. No, Quinton Aaron played big Mike in the movie Ah ok. It's sad about Michael's background though. He was placed in foster care and would run away each time. Yes it is. The father of whose couch Michael had been sleeping asks Burt Colten , the coach at Wingate Christian school gets him admitted despite his poor academic record. Yeah it's cool what the Tuohy's do for him. Like Leigh Anne telling him he must protect he quarterback as a lineman, but in ordxer to do so, he has to maintain the minimum gpa

The movie is about a rabbit becoming a police officer. She is discriminated against because of her species. She meets a sly fox named Nick Wilde. Do you need more information about the movie or have I convinced you? If you need more convincing there has been good reviews about the movie with Rotten Tomatoes giving it 98% approval and an average rating of 8/10.

The main character is Jordan Belfort, who is played by actor Leonardo DiCaprio. I'm a big fan of him. I' I've seen alot of his movies.
Yeah. Pretty much. Terrence Howard is in it. He plays a friend of Stark's and the liaison between Stark Industries and the USAF department of acquisitions, specifically weapons development. Jeff Bridges is also in the movie. I haven't heard of Terrence Howard, but I have heard of Jeff Bridges He plays Obadiah Stane, Stark's second in command, mentor and friend. He attempts to screw over Stark. Oh, so he's the villain? Yes. It's a classic superhero/super villain dynamic. Let me guess - is Stane trying to steal Stark's secrets? Exactly. The reviews were pretty decent. Rotten Tomatoes gave it a 94% Metacritic 79/100 and CinemaScore A That's not bad. I should take a look. Do you know if it was more for the comedy, or the action? I think it was more for the action. But the comedy is a big part of it. Have a great day!
Evan was a pretty unlikable character, he undermined Bruce. What do you think of this particular key scene that is being described in the document now It is urban/suburban Bruce also treats Grace rather poorly in this movie. He acts rather selfish. I agree, he should have been clear about his emotions to her (in regards to the coworker) Yes, Bruce later begins to realize his responsibilities.
oo funny , a kid in my sons class called them a dodge mustang . hat is funny . does your son like dragon ball z o , lol he is sixteen . cars and box are his thing
Absolutely. The fox is a "con artist" and the Otter is the bad guy. The police chief is a Water Buffalo. Idris Elba and Ginnifer Goodwin Oh I liked Ginnifer Goodwin.
That sounds very interesting. What event in history is it portraying? It is about the World War II's evacuation of Dunkirk. Sounds like an interesting topic. Probably something I'd go out and see. Have you seen the film personally already? Nolan does a great job directing this film, and has a great vision. What I think makes this movie unique is that has 3 main situations happening and they are all happening simultaneously and different time increments. I have seen it personally, one of my favorite movies of all time. I haven't seen many films in the past few months (a bit behind). Sounds like it is very captivating. Do you know much about the background and World War II It's been a while since I've brushed up on the finer details, but yes I do have a good idea about WWII. What else about the movie did you like? The main portion of the movie revolves around a single soldier that was the sole survivor of his team that was attacked. It follows him as he tries to get on a huge evacuation ship. You follow him and the relationships he make with other soldiers.

I think his ideas just get better and better as the movie progresses.
i like to watch face off on the syfy channel was that the movie about the guys in the high security prison ?
Do you like Christmas movie ? yes I do and you Have you seen it before Yes I do, this is one of my favorite Christmas movie,  Home Alone
It was highly praised by the critics yeap, but in my opinion It was named the fifty greatest teen comedies My favorite part was the girls hating on each other it is too much viewed I liked it too ^^ Rotten tomatoes gave it 84 percent so it seems it could have been hated and liked as well but too many movies like it are made even if it is correct I think Lindsey Lohan who plays candy is a good actress in this Do you often watch this kind of movie ? Mean girls is similar to most favorite teen shows.  Rachael madams iplays Regina George exactly
its a lot of work , but does not leave me much time to shop with my daughters . i bet but i bet it shows your style yeah i suppose . what do you do for work ?
Yeah, once they started working together it changed a lot. What was your favorite friendship moment between Buzz and Woody? Oh I suppose the reconnaissance mission. Yours? I liked that part and how at the end of that scene they found out that Andy got a puppy for Christmas
Doubtful! Good, those make my nose hurt. She winds up sparing Maru and kills him. How tall is Maru? Then she is reaffirmed into her new mission to fight on the world's behalf
Yeah any academy awards for the movie? Yes, it won several. It also has a 92% rating on rotten tomatoes. that's great :-) Yep. Did it get any Oscars? Yes. 6 wins from the Oscars--the first film to ever achieve as such. So one of the best movies ever Well that's subjective--I watched it and thought it was a little overrated. Just because it was slightly cliched, and I personally feel that I've seen better films. But nonetheless it's still worth the watch. Will love to do that, Is it available online? Yes, for sure.
Wow it sound intriguing. It takes place in a secret government facility and involves Soviet spies and the government's attempt to study this creature. The woman who is a mute is a cleaner at the facility. Does she free him, it? When did the movie come out? Hmmm, no information on that. It stars Sally Hawkins as the mute cleaner, and Octavia Spencer is in it as well. Critics say things like, it "isn't groundbreaking, [but] it is elegant and mesmerizing." It came out in 2017 not sure what date Do you want any ratings? One of the critics calls Sally Hawkins' character "mentally handicapped," which isn't exactly PC and obviously isn't accurate. Bueller? Bueller? Sorry, just a joke. You disappeared on me, Okay, so, I thought we were going to talk about a second movie, but this info is about the same one... It's directed by Benicio del Toro Oh, and Michael Shannon is in it as well, I recognize that name. He plays a corrupt government agent. I like him I have some information about a couple of scenes, do you want to hear any of that> Sure Sally Hawkins' character is named Elisa Esposito. She lives in an apartment above a cinema, communicates in sign language, and she has strong bonds with her neighbor Giles (an artist) and Zelda, a woman she works with. (I guess that's more setting the stage) Oh pk Apparently, the facility she works at receive a creature that was captured in a South American river. She's curious about it, so she takes a look and discovers it's humanoid. This is good - she ends up keeping the creature in her bathtub and plans to release him into a nearby canal. This is all taking place in Baltimore. So, that answers your earlier question. What year is the movie supposed to take place in? 1960s..in Baltimore Critics seem pretty high on the movie overall, at least based on what I have.
i , what do you do in your free time ? please do not laugh , but i collect many different bugs and keep them in jars ! i wo not laugh . i like reading , my all time favorite is david copperfield . cool ! he is a great magician ! what do you do for a living ? i currently work in it , i build computers . i was previously a mechanic for 6 years . sweet . my twin brother is a mechanic ! wesome ! so what do you do for a living ? i am a competitive dancer ! but i am too short to be a ballerina . cool ! have you won anything ? yes , many tap competitions . reat ! so , where are you from ? i live in the northeast part of the united states . you ?
hat would so cool if iron maiden also played the game i have never really played the destiny series is it fun ?
I actually think that Jesse Eisenberg was a great Lex Luthor. I can't really think of a better person to fill that role. I also approve of Henry Cavill  as Superman. Are you more for Batman or Superman? I am definitely more for Superman.  Henry Cavill is amazing for the part.  It really really bothered me when he died. How do you feel about Wonderwoman being in there? I am more for Batman. I mean he has no special powers just his money. That is awesome. Do you think Zach Snyder did a good job directing? Wonderwoman seemed to be just added with no particular point. I mean I am sure it was to hint at the Justice League. The movie was directed well but the screen writers should have done a little better. In my opinion. What would you have changed about the movie?
sometimes i get woke up yes that is never fun . i have 3 kids . i dot know sleep
ooh yummy . i love mexican cuisine ! ve you been to mexico ? i have , also to europe . only australia . actually saw a solar eclipse there last time i went cool ! i would love to swim in australia oceans .
I would say that, because of all the things he does, and at his young age. In the real world the kid would just call the cops. And not get forgottent by their parents. One would hope! What would you say was the most iconic scene? w What I remember is when the mom screams Kevin in the air plane. Yes! When she realizes what happened. Plus who can forget John Candy's cameo I would say the booby-trapping of the house was another big scene Yes, he was great. The best one was heating the doorknob. Yes, that or the burning of the scalp. ouch quite painful, i still don't know how the rest of the family was able to make it on Christmas day back. That was also fun about it. True, I believe that Macaulay Culkins real brother made a cameo in the film too.
i loved cooking with my mother but unfortunately she died when i was a child . well as a kid seeing the eclipse was amazing
ver read it . i like sci fi stuff though ve a favorite chi fi movie or book recommendation ? ything by ray bradbury is good imo . i also like philip k dick interesting i would have to check those out , why do you want to marry someone ?

The ending was neat where he copped to being Iron Man, setting up the sequel.  The comics made a big deal of his secret identity for decades.

Not really, it was mostly centered around the research facility where Turing worked with his team. I think there were no war scenes in it at all. Do the war scenes bother you? I don't like to see war scenes when it has to do with Nazis. The Enigma machine sounds interesting? Yeah, the Enigma machine was definitely the highlight of the movie. How do you feel about the fact that Turing was gay? Do you think they should have omitted that fact in the movie? No, if that's really who he was, I guess it would be important to his character. It sounds like he might have should have kept it secret back then though. Yes I guess he wasn't secretive enough in his real life. But don't you think that the exploration of his sexuality distracts from the message of the movie? Or do you think it actually aids the movie's aim?
lol, I found that funny, Rocky with robots I would not have compared this to a classic like Rocky yeah me too, I think it is funny i know but the movie does feel like that the other bullet point says, it better a cliche I can see some thing mixing. the human strugle now I rember it better where hugh jackman fights the bull in the beginning the next to last bullet point is funny, "Though the premise of fighting robots does seem a plausible and intriguing extension of the contemporary WWE world. reminds of Robots VS wrestlers in How I Met Your Mother  episdoes probably that was funny That was funny fight, watching a robot fight a bull yeah that is funny I thought the robot would win, lol the bull was the real rocky lol yes he was I did also like the little robot knocking out the big zeus yeah, it had too it has such a bad rating though 59% I was looking at that. the other is a 56 out of a 100 probably it is those expert reviews cause the last one it gives an A cinemaScore guess it depends on the person, the mood they are in when they watch it. I liked the experts better the experts liked it, lol
wanna read a funny joke ? does it involve a vegetarian who eats sushi ? o , but that sounds funny . i will add that to my rep . ll . the parental units still pay my rent , what can i say ? hat is heavenly . i will drink my cuba libre to that one . ll things considered , that sounds good . i shall make one for my dog . in my little town when i live , all dogs drink cuba libre . its good for them .
d where is that ? i like a variety florida . no seasons , always hot
Exactly I felt like it really made me want to see the next one. They set up the sequel really well at the end of this film. What was your favorite aspect of the movie? I liked the transformation that Wayne took on, playing the double life and so forth, it really made clear the difficulties of maintaining the secret identity. What did you like? I would agree with that. It's  a very good point. I also always enjoy the love saga as well. I am not typically for comic book movies so adding that for me helps draw me. Well, they really did not explore much of the relationship between Wayne and Rachel, and by the second one, she had left him for someone else Ok you know what that's where I was thinking in the second one because it's when she is with Harvey. I thought they did a great job with all of his gadgets and devices for fighting crime. And you can't go wrong with Morgan Freeman helping with that. Morgan Freeman is awesome in every movie he is in I love the part when he gets back at Hauer's character: "Didn't you get the memo?" I crack up every time
what kind of literature interests you ? italian and i love mexican food
i am 17 years old
yeah some do , i do not and i like to surf i love swimming on the weekends swim in the ocean , i have brown curly hair . ice i also enjoy reading what do you like to read ? little bit of everything
Definitely! The scenery was perfect too! I don't think I'll be traveling to New England beaches anytime soon!
before i run in the mornings i like to eat a bagel with all the trimmings
Best part of the movie for me was easily the battle between Superman and Batman. It was short but very entertaining. I liked the fact that Batman wants to stand up against Superman because of the aftermath of his battle with Zod. It sets a good tone for the start of the movie.
That's good. Do you feel that all the characters were well developed? No. The "Gibson" character could have been better developed. What about casting choices? Were the actors all pretty decent for their character roles? They were, with some surprises like Harry Styles making the cast. Do you feel they were pretty accurate with the props and clothing for the time period portrayed since it was a historical drama? Yes. Not only in the military side, but also in regards to the characterization of civilian life. What was your favorite part of the whole movie? The scene where Tommy, Alex and Gibson hide inside a trawler.

Yes it is a classic story model, of the rivals that eventually become the best of friends, but Disney has a way of making it feel fresh and new, and not overdone.

Agreed, there typically aren't many shark attacks in New England, usually further south or on the west coast. I can't imagine I would keep going to the beach as a tourist if lots of people kept turning up dead.

Yeah, definitely. The criminal underworld and the Russian Crime Syndicate is really full of potential for lots of new stories and characters. I think it could be an entire universe like Star Wars or Star Trek.

Yeah I've seen it 3 times. Have you seen it? Yes I have seen it a few times. Did you like it? Who was your favorite character? Yeah I think it was a good introduction to the series I like the movies in general. I'd say captain America is my favorite. Who is your favorite character? I agree with you that the metacritic score seemed low. Iron Man is my favorite.  He's so snarky and jerkish. Yeah I think Robert Downey Jr. was the perfect actor for Tony Stark I think the key scene is the only thing different on the document doesn't seem like we got much new info to talk about.
Well they try to break in. Kevin rigs the home with numerous booby traps. The 2 robbers break in and set off the traps. Kevin gets out safely after calling the cops. But they catch up with him at a nearby home!

What is the name of the movie? Hi. The movie is "Toy Story". It is from 1995. Is there a leading actor listed? Tom Hanks plays Woody. What about the director? Is the director listed? Have you seen it? I have. The director is John Lasseter. It rated 100% on Rotten Tomatoes. Are there any descriptions of Woody's character? Woody is a pull-string cowboy toy. The toy belongs to Andy Davis a human 6 year old boy. Is there any mention of other toys? There are a lot of other toys in Andys room. I personally like Rex the most. It's a T-Rex toy. Is Rex described in any way? (fierce, timid, etc.) Rex is always nervous. Does Rex seem relatable to you? Sure, just like any other nervous dinosaur model. I guess most people remember Buzz Lightyear.

HaHa, yeah one thing I can say about alot of the 1980's films is they were creative and original, rather than all these sequels trilogies and remakes going on now. Have you ever seen any of scenes of the movies. I was really popular. The first scene with the girl swimming was awesome. We used to redo the scene when we were kids in the pool. Her being pulled under by the shark. Then of course, people would try to scare you at the beach by sneaking up under you while you were in the water. Do you live where there are lots of beaches?

It premiered in 2009 and got an 86% on Rotten Tomatoes, The name of it is Inception and it stars Leonardo DiCaprio \. Do you like sci-fi? Yes, I have heard of this movie. I'm not usually a huge fan of science fiction but I've heard it's pretty good. Have you seen it? Yes well I haven't seen it and it looks good.  The description I'm reading says DiCaprio and another guy are "extractors", that is they infiltrate the minds of others.  They plant ideas in their subconscious, thus the name "Inception". It says DiCaprio plays a professional thief. That sounds pretty interesting. Is it a thriller? It says scientific.  It sounds like a thriller because it talks about corporate espionage. Are there other big names in the movie? Actors whose names I would recognize? The other actors/actresses listed are Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, and Tom Hardy. I like all of those actors. So that seems pretty good. Do you know how long it is? They are trying to break up the company of their main competitor. The 1st key scene has them inserting themselves into their competitor's dream after his father's body gets sent back to California from Australia. So they are inside this guy's head and he fires weapons at them in the dream, so then they manage to kidnap him and take him to a warehouse. The competitor ends up in some quasi Limbo land that sounds like a coma or something.

Nice i feel like watching it too I think we need to do a few more questions. Did you like Margot Robbie as Naomo Lapaglia?
The night howlers clue followed throughout the movie. Yes it did which was pretty interesting. Also, the recording carrot pen was great. It was a great take on carrots for rabbits! Haha yes that part was unexpected and awesome! When they were able to access the traffic cameras and found it where Manchas was going and that he had been captured by the wolves, I didn't expect to see the mayor there at the asylum. I didn't expect that either, I thought he was a bad guy at first. In a way he was I guess because he was involved, but he was really trying to help. When Bellwether took over as mayor, I was a little surprised even though she was the assistant mayor before.
I am not too familiar with her work either. She seems decent in Maleficent though. Good, since she plays the lead or co lead They have pretty good critical responses
this creatures understands everything

I am not expert on that so maybe clueless, and so in this case ignorance was bliss. I think the 92% from rotten tomatoes was deserved. Yeah, I think overall the film was well rounded and a good time ya the critical acclaim is deserved. one said it was elegant and mesmerizing and I agree. I also really thought Richard Jenkins was wonderful as Giles the nieghbor. Yeah, I wished there was more of him. The end of the film was more violent then I though it was going to be, how did you feel about it Maybe.. I do think they pieced it all together well. I think it needed some climax And also gave way to the whole ending. I really liked when the scars on her neck became gills. That was a little confusing for me. Are we meant to assume that's what her scars were the whole time They were there from the start of th emovie. she was found as childin the river with wounds on her neck
i do , i like to take more of animals and nature though .

do you know if this was a high budget movie? Sharlto Copley as Stefan was good. He played a convincing villian I'm not sure. Do you like movies related to fairy tales? oh ok. i am not a big fan of fairy tales movies, but if they have a deep meaning i could enjoy them. ok we can now finish the conversation. thx This movie does have some deeper meaning. More than just the animated movie.
maybe if there were sharks
h i am a professional chef
i will never be a grandmother , but i have some precious great nieces and nephews . hat is very sweet . what do you like doing ?
Was this movie a box office success? I'm not sure about that but some critical responses include "is cute, and funny, and the animation, though not exactly inspired, is certainly colorful." So it basically will leave the audience laughing out loud? Maybe you can check online! Did you know that there is a key scene I like where at the beginning Michael "Mike" Wazowski, a 7-year-old monster, aspires to become a scarer – a monster who enters the human world at night to scare children and harvest their screams for energy after seeing Monsters, Inc. Monstropolis' most profitable scaring company, on a school field trip. This is what prompts him to go to Monster's University! So would you personally recommend a family with a 5 year old and a 7 year old to go watch this movie?
hat is amazing what kind of snakes are they ? we have one in our class i have an anaconda and a python
I mean the plot was pretty dark... but it starts with Malefecents first love, stefan he betrays her to the king and it makes her turn the moors into a foreboding place She gets a Raven servant that she transforms into different beings as needed and pretty much retreats into her darkness Angelina is perfect for a dark role It's true.  Even critics that didn't like it say she was the highlight of the film I mean I understand the characters darkness too... Stefan betrays her by cutting off her wings with iron... that's pretty mercenary Stefan is played by Sharito Copley... and Aurora by Elle Fanning I'm glad to see Angelina getting praise for a role wow i like the dark edge Oh sure, and well deserved.  Maleficent watches over Aurora from afar... and she really portrays that kindness under the bitter Aurora's innocent 'mistake' of calling Maleficent her 'fairy godmother' makes her want to undo the curse on the child... but she can't... an discovers its only broken with true loves kiss aw so its bittersweet

hahaha. That's one of the best reviews ever. I'm glad that I didn't watch it. I kinda of want to now, just to see how bad it is. I think this movie definitely falls into the rent and watch at home catagory oh yeah, or find it free somewhere. I think I'd kick my own butt for paying for it. "As the film progresses, Lex degenerates into a gibbering mad man, some strange mix of the Riddler and teh Joker with a little bit of Mark Zuckerberg added for flair." *the Ahhh.. Zuckerberg. Did the same guy play Zuckerberg and Luther? Seems like I vaguely remember that from the trailers. Jesse Eisenberg It did appear people liked this movie more than Man of Steel, have you watched that? when it came out. I wasn't a fan. I haven't seen it since.

Good, thanks. Iron man was a pretty good movie Yea it was pretty good, I agree. I liked the first one much better than the others. Do you think Robert Downey Jr made a good Tony Stark?

its is a true story and at some points very funny, but can also be depressing at times And you said that Leonardo DiCaprio was in it ? What was his role ? he plays jordan belfort a wall street stockbroker and leaves to make money for himself So he leaves his job as a stockbroker to do what ? he opens his own firm with donnie azoff played by jonah hill I like him he is funny. he played a great role in the movie, it is all based on a true story

i do not like music at all what about sports , are you athletic ?
Sounds coo, I'd be interested in seeing it. Thanks for talking today! My pleasure.
ya you're right. the story line of this movie is making us so interesting to watch further more with full of interest. According to the document I have on my side of the screen here, the Metacritic score for the movie was only 69/100 while other places rated it at A+ or 8/10. I wonder why metacritic rated it so low. It was a 85 or 90/100 at least to me. How about you? Yeah, I too feel about the same. At my point of view the rating may be in the range between 80 -90 Fave part of the movie? I understand you might be doing other HITS right now but this is taking longer than it needs to. Iron Man going into the portalby Kelly West is the fav part of mine sorry for the delay which is your fav scene

I think I'll wait until I can watch it at home. It's much less scary for me to watch scary movies like this cuddled up with a blanket. Steve nSpielberg is such a good director though. I would hope he would do the next one as well. Yeah, he is a great director, I've seen a lot of his things. I agree on the watching it at home. The other people freaking out always makes it more scary for me though! I always liked Roy Schneider and Robert Shaw too though. I think they both did great in this one. I agree! It does add another level of fright to hear the others scream. Did you read the book before the movie came out? I haven't yet, but I wonder how well the movie followed the plot of the book. No. I didn't even realize there was a book. I am more of a movie person. Do you usually watch thrillers like this? Even if it is at home under the blanket? Yes. They are some of my favorites. There is something about the suspense. Like in the beginning of the movie when the girl skinny dipping gets pulled under... my heart was racing! Oh I know! I actually jumped and gasped and was like Get out of the water! They never listen though. That should teach you not to skinny dip in the ocean though What did you think of that mayor though? More concerned with money than people's safety when he had them change the death to a boat accident instead of the shark attack? Yup. Maybe if he had taken it seriously no one else would have been hurt. At least the shark hunter Quint offered her services, even though I think that was more for the cash than anything. True, but then we wouldn't have gotten this awesome movie! As for Quint, it's always about the money isn't it? I think the bounty should have been higher then it was though. That was one dangerous shark.
only through books and tv haha
i am working at a retail store do want to quit and go to the creek with me ? got beers ! i do not drink and i am a vegan
i am fine , how are you ? i have been watching shows on netflix tonight . oh not me , i like fishing too much to sit around watching tv . hat is nice ! i spend time hiking , but fishing is a bit too boring for me . well i live on a small island so not much else to do here . what island do you live on ? small island in hawaii . off the coast of maui , its not even on a map . it must be beautiful there , must be wonderful to spend time outside . yes 75 degrees all year long . only 3 families and my dog live here . i prefer colder weather , so that would not be so good for me . i named him bob because his fur looks like a bobcat but he is a dog . if i had a dog , he would probably eat my parrot .
do you have plans for tonight ?
i am kinda doing both . i like the aspect of nursing more than accounting hat is three careers you have so awesome .
I believe it. I remember reading about the lawsuits when they were filed. I think they have great lawyers to protect themselves though... The film starts in 2003 when Zuckerberg was a 19 year old student at Harvard. He actually created a campus website called Facemash that allowed users to rate the attractiveness of photos of female students. That is a really good overall description for someone who wants a synapse of the movie. Oh, that's just the beginning. That website was so popular it got the attention of the Winklevoss twins, who were upper class men who made a dating website exclusive to Harvard.  So the origins of the idea for the site are kind of vague
Good.  Have you seen Iron Man? I have. I love Iron man movies. It got a 94% rating on Rotten Tomatoes! Can you believe it was released in 2008? At least they got a high rating. Has it really been 10 years already? I guess so.  If memory serves me correctly, Robert Downey Jr. played Tony Stark/Iron Man. He did.  I can never remember the name of his girlfriend.  I think her name is pepper in the movies. He played the "genius inventor" and owned Stark Industries which was a weapons manufacturer for the US Gov. And he had jarvis.  :) his new ones don't have jarvis anymore. makes me sad.

It's streaming on one of those services. Have you read any of the reviews of Zootopia? not an entire review only snippets from a couple They all pretty much agree. It's funny, likable, good animation... what more could you ask for any other films it compares to? Secret Life of Pets would be the closest. As is with a lot of movies, it has a little twist at the end. I won't spoil it. youve got me on the edge of my seat who is your favorite director ? I'm a big fan of Christopher Nolan. Zootopia apparently had two directors which is odd. that is odd so i assume you have seen inception? I've seen it. I still don't get that movie. Zootopia is a lot simpler, obviously. It's made for children. But smart enough for adults. what do i do now

It is a black comedy not action Under Hanna, Belfort engages in sex, fraud, and drugs oh right. Gotcha. So, funny, but a dark funny. Hanna is a fellow stockbroker for Rothschild Sounds interesting. I'm sure has true elements of that life. Yep, Jordan Belfort later starts a company with his buddy Donnie Azof Well, I guess he learned many tricks of the trade with the company The company scams people Will he try to not scam people in his new company?

You've got to have a little sympathy for her when she gets hit by the bus though! hahha true I like that they all confess their faults though That scene is so great and really funny! But it's understandable that Janis takes the opportunity to rat Cady out because the Plastics are still so awful to her. haha yes she just wanted revenge Which she immediately got when Regina got hit by the bus. but you are right poor regina getting hit by a bus and breaking her spine was no fun I like that Cady takes the blame for the burnt book I agree! And I like that she doesn't just take the title of prom queen and instead breaks the tiara and shares it with everyone.

Are there any other interesting villains? Yes, there is a crime boss named Mr. Big. What kind of animal is Mr. Big? Is he as big as his name implies? I do not have that information. Are the Fox and Mr. Big in league with one another? The fox sees to be on the bunny's side against Mr. Big. Do the bunny and fox succeed in the end? Well, there is a  complication, and the bunny upsets the fox. She quits her job. Have you seen the movie yourself yet? No, I have't seen it, but it sounds funny and smart. Do you like animated movies? Yes, I do. This sounds like a very good movie. I will be sure to go see it. Great! An interesting part is a prey-supremacy conspiracy the bunny discovers. That sounds like it could definitely disrupt the bunny's alliance with the fox.

That's good to know. I hate when long movies seem to drag on forever. Would you watch it again? Same here my friend, especially for a biopic of some kind and the movie is heavy on the story, Catch me if you can is cleverly good! Of course! Classics like this is timeless honestly. They dont make movies like this anymore. Do you have a favorite part of the movie? Or a favorite character? No spoilers but theres a scene somewhere that reveals a great part or fills a plot hole of the movie. It keeps you speculating for a bit but then when the scene enters, it will satisfy you. Thats all Im giving away haha.

I think it was a really interesting movie. I think I liked it more because I am a Facebook user so it was more relatable. What did you think? I love the people who play in it. They are excellent actors and with it being about Facebook, it's super relatable to anyone watching it. Did you have a favorite character or actor? I really liked Jesse Eisenberg in this movie as mark Zuckerberg He was really good, I really liked how well Andrew Garfield did as Eduardo Saverin. What do you think of having Saverin being consulted for the movie? I think that was a good idea. But I have to wonder how accurate the whole movie is since Zuckerberg didn't get to consult on the movie and he is the founder! I do find it interesting they didn't get him in on the movie. I wonder if it's because he refused to do it or they  decided just not to contact him? I think he didn't want to get involved with the whole Hollywood scene and perhaps the movie doesn't make him look as good as he would like Because in the movie, Facebook started as a whole Hot or Not program, which is slightly offensive haha That's what I was thinking. I figured the movie made him look like a bad guy and he didn't want to get anything additionally bad tagged to him. That and he may be trying to stay away from the lime light with something like that
It's about the publishing of the pentagon papers by the washington post in the 1970's It came out recently in 2017.
oh , fun . i enjoy reading when i have time . i was going to ask what you enjoy !
Hi Have you been to a movie lately? Have you seen Dunkirk? Have you seen Dunkirk? Have you seen Dunkirk? No. Isn't that a city in France? The movie is Dunkirk, it is based on the evacuation of Dunkirk during WWII. Who directed it?
do you watch sports ? i love watching hockey
i always park away from other vehicles so i make sure i do not hit anything hat s a good trick that i can follow it seems to work good for me . well i would just ask somebody else to do it
i am well , just getting ready to go to football practice . tell me about yourself i do not have time for football . i am a carpenter . i attend college on a scholarship . what do you like to build ? i build furniture . before that i was enslaved for ten years . slaved ? tell me more about that !
oh yeah . obviously ! you like watching movies ? i do since i have so much alone time so , whats your fav . movie ?
the score is wonderful and helps with the movie watching experience in this movie i do not know who does the score OK, anyway it should be good. I wonder  if being a toy story , does it have in the cast any famous toy you can buy in a store? well the characters like woody, buzz, and t-rex are all charcters in a film about toys, but are fictional and not based on real life toys, im sure you can buy them in the store now however sid phillips is their neighbor and he is the scary villian in the movie, so he might be a little frightening for kids but other than that the movie is very kid friendly
Hello have you seen the Great Gatsby? Yes. I actually liked it, how about you? I liked it a lot. Leonardo Dicaprio is great in it I thought so too. Tobey Maquire was also fun to watch. Yeah, their chemistry was pretty good. I thought that Baz Luhmann did a good job directing. How did you feel about it versus the book? I thought it was a good depiction of the book It seems it was not particularly critically acclaimed... No not really. It looked like a lot of the well known review rating pages gave it average scores. I'm not familiar with Lurmann...what else did he direct? Rotten Tomatoes only gave it 48% I'm not sure Did the movie ever cover what Gatsby did for a living exactly? I don't think so. He's pretty much just a famous billionare who hosts crazy parties so Daisy will show up Did Daisy have blonde or brown hair? I forgot. blonde. Thanks. I did think the movie was a bit long.
wow ! you have me beat ! only 2 of each here . crazy cat lady is what i would be described as i am the domestic house wife . nothing crazy over here . me too , we should have a tea party some time . hat sounds nice . very tranquil which is what i need . lso i enjoy crocheting in my free time , what about you ? i love zumba . i feel since now i am thirty , i need to exercise more

the movie was certainly epic in size and narrow in scope. Are we supposed to be getting a separate document for this survey soon? I enjoyed the penny stock scene where he more of less teaching them all how to sell at that very small investment firm. no the top just updates with a new scene to discuss ah. I see it now. Martin Scorsese Do you know any other movies directed by him? no, doesnt sound too familiar and I'm not sure what "black" comedy is referring to as a genre $22 million in 3 hours. that's crazy. black comedy is like dark comedy or is generally considered taboo ah ok It was interesting watching how like he went from normal life, to middle class, to rich, and then loses it all kind of moral of story about greed in a way can't believe he was only imprisoned for 3 years.

I am not sure about that It is the 2nd live action film for the Wonder Woman character though Interesting, would I be able to follow the plot without seeing the first movie? It appears that you are able to; yes. The film follows Wonder Woman as she grows up on the Amazon island of Themyscira. A pilot named Steve Trevor crashes on her island and Wonder woman rescues him. So you don't need that first movie to pick up the plot from the beginning Interesting Are other superheros in the movie? I don't know about superheros. There is though Robin Wright who plays Antiope and she is the general of the Amazonia army and she is Wonder Woman's early mentor The main lead male character is Chris Pine Cool, is there a lot of actions scenes or is it more politics? Well according to critical responses someone considers it "a war movie" There is definitely a lot of action in the movie Sounds like my kind of movie.
he is retired now but still has connections .
othing . sitting here farting . i like the smell . ll well that is something . yes , and i always blame others for what do . i am a good person . hat is does not seem good . do you work ? i am retired now
i am ramanan from india and your are from ??? I am Philip from the USA So what did you think of Dunkirk?? its a great movie with a mind blowing visuals. really loved enjoying in the big screen have you seen it Yes I saw it on opening night.. great sound quality and I feel like they made it very loud Quite the immersive experience nolan never fails his fans right. Thought there could have been more story I'll watch anything he directs I like when Jonathan is involved too though.. hethey write great atories together yes about the soldier  who boarded the boat could have been explained a little bit more Yes he seemed like a side character .. I'll have to watch it again lets hope this continues forever and giving their best I kept waiting for a time shift at some point since it's usually a part of his movies what will you say best about the movie Nice immersive experience.. heartwarming overall storyline ya i think he is addicted to it on maintaining the time shifts i would say the background score and the visuals pulled every one at the edge of their seats Yep I agree with you! hero of this movie doent speak much but gave a good performance with his acting  for a new commer r u there I thought the changing of scene types were really neat to see (land sea and air) Could have been more with Tom hardy scenes yep i am a fan of tom hardy from interstellar, warrior and revenant and so on.
ice ! i could not get out of alabama fast enough i bet . what do you drive ? i have a cool , black car . yeah , not a ton to do there besides watching game of thrones and smoke meth . ha ha . you kid , i am certain . is alicia keys your favorite ? 2pac is my favorite . i drive a toyota tacoma btw . nothing fancy but it gets crazy gas mileage . othing like good mpg , i must admit . partly kidding once i smoked too much and saw the easter bunny hiding in my closet .
HI Have you seen the Martin Scorsese-directed film The Wolf of Wall Street? No. Who's in that movie? Is it a drama or a comedy?
I can see why rotten tomatoes only gave it 27%. At least General Zod had decent plot points. I am surprised CinemaScore gave it as high marks as they did Ya I suppose the gathering of kryptonian was somewhat interesting. I think they should have put Zod in the movie Ya, a B is very kind. The whole mother plot is ridiculous Batman is supposed to be smarter than that I think it is just confussing because of the shared name. But yes, he should be. weak Just silly. I mean these people spent millions of dollars on this project Also, superman dies? I don't think any of it is very believable. I thought that was his basic deal, that he was unkillable. I think they really missed the whole point. Also lex luthor, supervillain, is arrested? He is declared dead. Basically all the major characters fail their major reason for existing. Batman is stupid, Superman is mortal, and Lex Luthor is subject to arrest. A memorialnto a funeralis held Nice job, movie! I do not think they grasp the source material. I can't believe it a superhero genre film with such big stars could fail so miserably. But must be nice to be able to waste a fortune on an absurdist take on superheroes.
been working at the factory 10 years but my coworker gets promoted ow long was your coworker working there ? 5 years . if she had been there longer i would have understood it did she show more effort than you did ? what kind of work ? ope but i am not working overtime or anything anymore forget that . i am sorry . would you like to talk about another topic ? what do you do for a living i work at a nuclear power plant . what do you make at the factory ? i make little debbie cakes hose are yummy ! i also like spaghetti ! spaghetti is great and quick and easy to make hat may be why i like it ! do you do anything for fun ?
I completely agree and would strongly suggest a movie that he did in 2003, starring Morgan Freeman and Jennifer Anniston. It's about a down and out reporter that is complaining to god that he isn't doing his job correctly.
I remeber Ugly betty but I did not know she was in superstore An interesting thing to note is in the key scene it mentions shooting down a night fury, which is a rare and dangerous dragon; however, Hiccup's companion toothless is a night fury...doesn't sound like toothless is dangerous though with a name like that. Oh based off key scene 2 it seems like toothless was the dragon shot down?
the mathlete plot was looked very forced and boring yes pretty dull for sure

Good morning! Morning :) Do you like sports movies? Sometimes This one sounds good though :-) It is! It's less about football and more about the relationship between Sandra Bullock and Quinton Aaron. I notice that the critics praised sabndra Bullock''s performance which whets my interest. She was very good, One of her best movies His story also sounds good, going from an impoverished neighborhood to being drafted by the NFL.  I'm thinking it also sounds kind of inspirational as well. I didn't think so, only because he succeeds due to luck. If he hadn't met Leigh Anne then he wouldn't have had the opportunities he did. She just happened to know the right people. It's not something most people can do so it's more of a fantasy, I think. I'm wondering why it didn't receive higher reviews though- the article was saying only "moderately positive." The Metacritic score doesn't match the others - why so low? The Rotten Tomatoes score is low as well :( I can see that where the success due to luck is concerned.  That's true, if he hadn't come across the right people he would have stayed where he was at.  On the scores... I kind of wondered the same thing. Metacritic was just above half out of a hundred.  A movie that was one of Sandra Bullock's best movies should have been higher, and the scores kind of had me wondering as well if the two rating companies were a little bit skewed maybe? I think you're right, since the scores are crowdsourced. Many people see a movie about football and automatically hate it. Yes, crowd source as so much to do with it, what's popular vs. what isn't- even the season of the year or where it's playing- rural vs. city areas, small towns vs. larger areas, etc. Last time I saw this movie I was surprised Lily Collins was in it! She's underestimated Her I haven't heard of... She's done some netflix films recently, I think this was one of her first roles. She plays the adopted sister who stands up to bullies at the school Oh, still do not recognise. Are you still here?

Will have to watch myself What do you thunk about the cast? The only actress I had heard about was Octavia Spencer But they all seem like a great cast How do you feel about the secret government facility? I think that it's a great setting. I specially liked that it was set in the 60's since I'm interested in the Cold War What about her being found in a river? I thought that was sad But I liked that they used a mute character in the movie. What are your thoughts about a main character using sign language? I think that it's good More diversity in the movie industry Do you usually go for this genre? Fantasy drama How do you feel about the creature being captured and placed in the facility? How do you feel about her taking the creature? I think that it would be horrible if it's a sentient creature to keep it locked up I don't know. If it was a sentient creature, I don't think the government had any business keeping it locked up. How do you feel about the creature having healing powers ? Seems pretty fantastic What about her having relations with the creature ? I can't believe the creature would eat a cat Don't know. This movie has fantastic ratings. Do you think she went with the creature? Don't you think? I don't want to know to many spoilers *too

Glad we agree. I really liked the character Olaf, too. Yes very much, he added the fun element to the movie something similar to the Donkey in Shrek Yeah, except less sarcastic. I was sad when Elsa froze Anna's heart. It was heart breaking to watch the elder get rigid, but she did it for her sister

Yes, it was neat for them to base it on a Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale but give some twists to boot. I think it also set the stage for Disney to redefine itself in this genre. Exactly, and it opened doors for other new shows. You typed it faster than me. No worries, I am mostly using the source material on this end. Makes it easier. Speaking of which, what did you think of the colony of trolls? I thought it was one of the stranger aspects that didn't necessarily add that much to the movie. The trolls I believe were used for comedic relief. They weren't really a necessarily big part of the movie, except to explain Hans back ground. I can see that, and I guess it also showed what lengths the family would go through to ensure that Anna was healed after Elsa accidentally injures her. I found it interesting as well that her parents reaction was to lock her up until her coronation.

dude How is going? Have you seen the movie How to train your dragon? Oh no but i have heard quite much about it It is an animation movie i guess Yes, it is.....I saw it a few years ao ago It is a good animated fantasy movie ok, then it must be kind of great because the director is someone i know does good work Chris sanders to be precise I guess having such movie in 2010 would have made it probably one of the best of that time It was a bit different from the usual fairy tale movies It is kind of crazy dragons would steal livestock
Good, you? I enjoyed this movie, although not enough to rewatch it. i'm good thanks!  oh really?  I've seen it a few times.  Did you think Lenoardo DiCaprio was a good actor in it? DiCaprio was pretty good but I'm a bigger fan of Joseph Cordon Levitt. What did you think of his performance? I thought Joseph was really good as well.  I'm not normally fan of his, but he was outstanding in this film.  Tom Hardy really stole the show for me though.  He was hilarious and really cool.  What did you think of Tom Hardy? He had some very clever dialogue and I appreciate his delivery. It's more than I can say for Ellen Page, who I felt was a little flat for me. I thought she should have been more skeptical and resistant to the whole idea dreamscapes. What did you think of the concept? That's funny I was just about to say the same thing.  She seemed a little flast ot me as well.  I LOVED the concept of the film.  I know some people found it a bit ridiculous, but I loved how ambitious the concept and plot was.  Did you think Christoper Nolan did a good job directing?

I think it was a calculated but good choice to have a character's last name be 'weiners' sublte comedy Yes, and I also enjoy the irony in the term "Plastics." As society generally equates preppy girls to barbie dolls which are made of plastic. metacritic score was the lowest, it seems. wonder what that demographic is If I had to guess, I would assume older adults since this movie was generally aimed toward a younger demographic. the second scene listed does seem pretty unrealistic though, but i know with movies we have to suspend our disbelief a little. Yes, the fact that everything is sorted out by confessing transgressions seems very unrealistic. I was surprised that they chose to have Regina have such a brutal ending to this scene. yes, it seems unrealistic that everyone would turn on the 'queen bee,' it seems more likely her loss of power would be fleeting.
like eggplants which is purple . hat is one of the best !

o , do you have any pets ?
The only thing I really like about this movie is Keira Knightley, great actress. I'm overall very interested in the World War 2 genre, but I feel that it's overdone. That's the problem I have with this film. It didn't seem to bring anything interesting or new to the genre. I agree with your opinion on Keira Knightley. The cast was pretty well put together. My biggest problem with the genre is the inflated sense of conflict and action in most of the movies. I think the movie would have been better if the biopic had more closely mirrored the true story it is trying to portray. I concur. It's frustrating when you go and see a "based on a true story" and it is so far removed from the actual story, it might as well be a fiction movie. I really can't get into such movies, when I know they are given such artistic license. I also dislike Mathew Goode as an actor, and felt his acting fell flat in this movie. I had actually never seen Matthew Goode before, but I agree. He certainly isn't one of my new favorites. While I do enjoy biopics, it's like you said: it is sometimes so far removed, it might as well be fiction. It often removes the sense of authenticity from the film. Yeah well he's really horrible. He looks like he smells. Dirty and ragged looking. I don't even know why hollywood deals with him anymore. I feel he single handedly destroyed this film. I can't imagine how Keira Knightley even stood near him honestly.
i should invite your whole family to dinner and film the party hat would be exciting . my girlfriend would have to come in from salt lake city . would she fly in ? yes . if its okay she could bring change and boomer , our beagles .

yes , a few too . the first time i ever saw my wife was at a tickleback concert
yes, me too. It was an interesting enough story to keep me entertained. And it was true?! Agreed. If I'm watching a movie and not enjoying, I tend to not finish it rather than wasting the two hours of my time.  HA exactly. shouldn't we be advancing to the next script by now? lol Great characters and actors ;) I was just going to say I felt they had quite a few well known names in the cast list. I don't remember Christopher Walken being in it. I need to watch it again. It lists Martin Sheen on there
here are a cool band . when i am not listening to one direction , i think hiking is fun . i like to workout and do cardio summer time is the best time to hike in colorado . i bet because of all the snow in the winter working out and doing cardio is great while i listen to one direction .

Well the principal.. When I was watching the movie, I felt for him.. don't wanna be in his position Hahah yeah definitely Ms. Norbury handled this well And Ms. Norbury and others... it must have been a headache I like that Cady becomes her old self again in scene 3 It makes high school drama seem like a "phase" And here comes Aaron! Finally a boy enters the scene. Remember the tension when we watched? Haha yeah! I'm proud of her for reconciling with her friends and becoming elected Prom Queen, which shows her character development Yes. Very nice of her. Nice touch when she said "her classmates are wonderful in their own way" I'd say that was very mature of her I agree. I love that she's promoting acceptance and tolerance. It's a nice way to end the film. I think we're done!
do you make subs or are you at a grocery store ?

sOUNDS GREAT i WANT TO SEE IT Do you think Fionn Whitehead will play a convincing actor for the role of Tommy, the British Army private? 92% rotten Definitely playing a convincing private. Do you generally watch movies with such a good rating? Yes. Yes I watched Dunkirk because of it. Based on the summary, how do you think the story-line will play out? It sounds good. I like war dramas It does look pretty intense though. What's the genre? I loved this money Like the movie Patton. I loved this Dunkirk movie. I cried at the end. It was true. Plus I love, love british culture so that was a plus.
ll i have 3 , my parents do not know

Might be worth seeing the movie just to hear Pharrell. It is full of smart jokes that parents will catch but kids wont What did you think of the scene where Gru stole the Great Pyramid of Giza? Gru plans to steal and shrink the moon, another supervillian stole the pyramid The dynamic between two villians is great Sounds funny. It received a high rating from Rotten Tomatoes, 81 percent. Do you pay attention to the ratings? I don't usually on kids films, if my kids are interested, a rating won't deter them. Do you check out ratings before you see films? You are right about the plot. Sorry about that. Oh no worries! I've seen it a bunch of times lol Sometimes I will read the critical response. I guess one critic said it had "whiplash-quick laughs." I like that kind of comedy. Seeing the 3 girls warm up to Gru (and he them) was really sweet too It reminds you that there is good in everyone, even an evil supervillian lol What did you think of Gru's rivalry with Vector? It was hilarious. I love Jason Segal, he holds his own with Carrell Russell Brand was probably good as well, do you think? The introduction of the minions is great too Brand plays Nefario and to be honest, I didn't realize it was him until the 3rd movie
he world is not a safe place it should be for lions was my point . i hope you are not a bills fan o way i would never be a bills fan
just finished . now i spend all my time working on my family dairy farm . oh , that is amazing ! i miss all the fresh vegetables . we have got a lot of produce , i do not really like eating it though .
hi! Hello! Have you ever seen Batman Begins? I'm not sure, is that the one that came out in 2008? No, it actually came out in 2005 Oh, then I definitely didn't see it. Who's in it? It was one of the Christopher Nolan films. Christian Bale plays Batman and there's also Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, Katie Holmes, and Gary Oldman as the other main characters. Morgan Freeman is in it too I love Christopher Nolan films, and Christian Bale. Do you know if Cilian Murphy was in it, too? I think he was the scarecrow in another Batman franchise movie, not sure if it was that one.
odd . did you go to school ? i do not believe in school oh . i earned a masters degree .

Im not sure where Mark Zuckerber is originally from I think New York though What is his background, does the movie say as far as training before Harvard? The person Justin Timberlake plays in the movie is s Sean Parker who made napster
Yes sure..Its really big deal on Chris hemsworth i also think this movie has kind of served as a template for newer super hero movies the all star cast really helped too not sure you could do a movie better than this one for this style Yeah..but previous super hero acting is very well and adorable..
oh cool ! i played piano since i was 5 . its calming . my daughter plays the sax and several other instruments .
Was Justin Timberlake also in the movie? yes! he has an interesting role Could you please elaborate on his role?

o i have not but it does seem nice i am in love with a guy who does not seem to know i exist www that is sad have you talked to him
What was the name of the Pan-American airline pilot? Frank Abagnale Oh, now I remember it was Frank. I enjoyed his movies actually I enjoy most of all this movie by Steven Spielberg. He's a very good director Although it wasn't one of his major movies it was one that was very enjoyable. yes he really is a good director. Christopher Walken  is also a good actor. I agree The  background for many of the scenes which is just incredible. I wonder how he felt when he was told that his father had died. I know. This would be crazy if it happened in real life He was probably really sad I feel the same way as you do regarding that particular scene. it was fairly uncomfortable when I recognize that she had left his father for another man. That gave me the feeling of the real bummer. I felt the same way I'm glad he ended up happy though I especially enjoy the sea when Frank gave himself up. yes I can comprehend. There's always a great deal of action going on the movies that took place in New York City. That makes sense. New york city is a busy place All I enjoyed the point whereas he was working at the FBI. That part was exciting I had not realized that the check Carl was carrying was a fake. yes, is very exciting. Was it not Frank that pointed the fact that the check Carl was carrying was fake Yes it was .I also enjoyed the students seem where Frank was offered a deal by the FBI. I did too And when he tries to be a pilot It was pretty cool the way that he was able to work out the remainder of his prison sentence. yes can you imagine him being a pilot.
i hope i find my calling and not these voices i hear .

I've actually never read the book. What was it that ruined the movie for you? It was an unconventional portrayal and more gaudy than anything else. With the enormous budget they had, they really utilized it in the wrong ways to tell the story well. What could they have done better?
The plot revolves around loki and a powerful weapon called tesseract that could potentially destroy the earth. So I am assuming they save the earth? Scarlett Johansson plays Black widow who is one of the Avengers and not a villain Yes, they all team up to save the earth. Is it all the same characters for each sequel? I don't know about that but did you know that this movie got a cinema score of A+ No I didn't. I have never heard of this director before. Has he directed anything else? During the movie at some point the Avengers gets divided in how they'll approach Loki and save the earth. S.H.I.E.L.D. is this the agency they belong to? Joss whedon is the director of this movie and it is one of the parts of Marvel Cinematics. Yes, SHIELD recruits everyone. Nick fury is the leader of SHIELD
very amazing . what is your favorite music ?

Perhaps it is because he's a vigilante and hides his identity. But then so does superman... and all it takes for him is a pair of glasses for some reason. At least batman feels bad about how poorly relations went with Superman. Too bad Superman had to die.
no you are the first person i've talked to did you watch a movie? Yes! I just wanted to say that Tom Hanks is about the best actor out there, and that DiCaprio is amazing too. This movie is just one example of how he really turns into his character. DiCaprio, mainly, I mean. what was the name of the movie? It is Catch Me If You Can. A brilliant piece directed by Steven Spielberg and with a cast headed by Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks. It sounds like a solid cast, what is the movie about? Well, DiCaprio's character is named Frank Abagnale. He is a master impersonator. By age 19, he had pulled major con jobs worth millions of dollars by impersonating people. He mainly used the impersonations for check fraud. what is tom hanks character like? Well, I mostly want to talk at this point about Frank Abagnale. But Tom Hanks plays Carl Hanratty. We'll get back to him later. To appreciate him, you'd have to know about the roles that Frank Abagnale took on. What was Frank trying to accomplish? He wanted to make $$$$!!!  He originally needed it because he had run away from home. His parents had come into financial problems because of his father's tax problems and they had moved from their posh home to a small apartment. They had then filed for divorce. His mom had been carrying on with his father's friend anyway. He started by impersonating a subsititute teacher in his French class, and then after a series of impersonations, "became" an airplane pilot and forged payroll checks. Do you care to know the amount he stole?
my parents are very supportive , even of my vegan lifestyle .
sweet ! i am in a grunge band with one of my siblings . she drums , too ! i am in an indie band with my peeps ice . do you have any piercings ? my eyebrow is .
Haha! Yeah I think that would be too. If he takes over god, then does "god" take over for Jim Carey? Or do you think that Jim Carey as god will just be dealing with everybody? He could make vengeance funny Yeah, maybe thats where karma comes from.

Yes, she did. She did very well. The movie, and the star, surprised me with how good they were. Especailly after the mess of the Superman/Batman movie. I was told that the Super/Batman movie was trash. I only seen a few parts of it, but I was interested to finishes it .

I can't believe it's possible to impersonate an airline pilot. Oh, yes! That is inconceivable! I guess all it takes is confidence and desperation. I don't have the tool kit to do any of that. Do you? I can't imagine most of the things he manages to do. I am a teacher, so I might be able to do that one, but I don't knwo French. Overall, I really enjoyed this film and I will watch it again. I am glad that he got caught, though. And it's good that he managed to be turned into an asset for the FBI. Yes, that is the best part of it, that he was able to redeem himself and go on to do good work for society.

When I heard they were making another Monsters Inc movie I expected a sequel, not a prequel. But I ended up loving it! Did you see it in theatres? I don't think we saw it in the theatre.  I think we rented it.  It's been a while though.  I should show it to my kids.  They would probably like it. I bet they would! I don't have kids but my coworkers do. I love Disney/Pixar movies so I recommend them to my coworkers a lot. I really enjoy Randy Newman's music on this, the Toy Story movies, and Finding Nemo/Dory. Me too! I think the Toy Story movies might be my favorite Pixar movies. Did you hear that they're building a Toy Story Land in Walt Disney World this summer? I did hear that.  It sounds pretty interesting.
I have never heard that story. Is it like a direct adaptation or just sort of influenced by the story like other Disney movies? I'm not sure. My document just tells me "inspired by". I haven't read that story either. Ah gotcha. So who are the central characters in this movie?
what do you sell ? i am about to have my favorite lunch , pizza ! i sell my records . i once travelled through the usa as a musician , playing guitar . oh that sounds like fun . . i work at an auto shop , on trucks . . you ? mostly selling online compact discs that i gathered up while working the circuit . oh okay . where are you from ? missoula . i worked at a box factory there . okay , my doberman and i are in chicago
favorite part - do you wanna build a snow man song :P and yours favorite part? I like the trolls. Did you know the main one who heals Anna at the beginning is called the Grand Pabbie? no I feel bad for Elsa when she accidentally sets off eternal winter and the Duke calls her a monster. yes me too... but When she is finally on her own, she finds beauty in herself. Elsa sings the now Oscar-nominated "Let it Go" upon realizing that she is good enough for herself, and that's all that really matters. That's true. She creates her own palace, just for herself. Elsa proclaims that her freedom and ability to be herself without compromise are more important to her than anything
Oh wow,  nice, those guys are hilarious. Must be a funny film then, eh? I think the minions have their hands full in this movie lol yes it is bound to be funny Awesome, I'm a big fan of comedies so that makes me want to check it out. What's the plot? I love comedies as well the plot: the villain is trying to steal the great pyramind of giza so he goes to the bank to try to get a loan to pay for this adventure but the bank wants him to steal a shrink ray in order to get the loan Haha, that's ridiculous, I love it! yes I am definitely going to be watching this me too!!

ok they know that they are actually toys except one, Buzz Lightyear, an astronaut toy thinks he is real, not a toy and can fly in space Does Tim Allen do one of the voice overs? yeah, he is the Buzzlightyear also Tom Hanks is voicing the other main character I thought so. I like Tom Hanks as well. He's the cowboy right? yeah the movie is about the (somehow) challenge between the cowboy and the Buzz Lightyear they are both trying to be the best toy

Do you think this one was good enough to receive a 98% on Rotten Tomatoes, compared to other animated movies? I think so. If 98% of the people who view your film like it then you did your job as a movie maker. In the scene where Otterton went "savage," a friend of mine believes the savage state in this universe of Zootopia isn't the natural one. What do you think?
yeah it gets rough at times
sometimes . i feel incomplete without them
spent the summer in japan many mopeds and regular bikes there i bet there are ! it was so hot today i had to take a cold shower ! really ? the weather is beautiful here . in fact my mom painted outdoors today canvasses ! wesome ! i cannot wait for it to cool off !

Towards the end when he finally get caught and he's shredding all that paper. What was your fav scene? My favorite scen was when Ftank got offered the deal to work with the U.S goverment thought it was pretty good yeah It was based on a true story...right Yeah it was, thats what makes it even better yeah what do you think about the rest of the cast

Oh ok. I'm a little bit wary of rotten tomato ratings also They can sometimes stray quite far from the other review sites of a bunch of very keen reviewers want to bump the score Ok scene three has some drug manufacturing going on! Yes, the drugs make the animals revert to their natural state. Oh so there must be some other force making them break moulds
i am good and i hope you are as well i am i telling you been having problems with my truck . do you fix cars ? o i sing sorry i can not help
y 2 daughters really like pink i get concentrated and draw all the time . i think i am pretty good . i would love to see some of your work sometime . what else do you like ? i like watching movies with the wife .
Hello user 2. Zootopia would be a great choice for you to watch tonight. What is Zootpia about? Can you describe the contents of the movie? It's a great comedy with action and adventure. It is about a world full of animals, and one rabbit's dream of being a police officer in their world. So it is a good family movie? Yes, definitely. Rotten Tomatoes score of 98%! Very good reviews from all over. Is it a good movie for the whole family? Maybe not very young children, but your family will really enjoy it. Do you know who voice the main characters? Byron Howard and Rich Moore Does the movie have excitement? Yes, there is one scene where Judy  is trying to get Nick because he is suspected in Otterton's last known sighting. You mentioned a fox and a rabbit, what other animals are depicted in the film? I am not sure about that. Which character seemed the most endearing to you? I really like Nick, he gets in trouble but at the same time he seems to have a soft heart. It does sound like a good movie to watch. Yes, Judy and Nick become friends and he joins her in their quest to get help. Is Nick the Fox? Yes, Nick is the fox.

Oh, that is a great cast? Henry Cavill played Superman in the latest Superman film right? Sorry, a great cast! I am not sure but the film is still a part of the DC extended universe. Also it will be featuring wonder woman. Ooh, that is excellent. I am looking forward to seeing Wonder Woman! Are Batman and Superman enemies at the start of the film? Well lex luthor manipulates batman into a battle with Superman because he is obssessed with cloning superman. Oh! So Batman is supposed to bring Superman to Lex Luthor? No that is not the case however he is manipulated into helping. By the way did I mention this is going to be the first time batman and superman are in a movie together? Really? The first time? That seems pretty amazing knowing that the characters have been around for so long! Very cool. Is the story set in Metropolis or Gotham?
I love this movie Zootopia, I have watched it numerous times! have you ever seen this movie me too i love it what's you find interressant about the movie I love how they used different animals in the movie as a way to portray different kind of people Like the slow sloths at the DMV that part was hilarious and so true, if we were animals the workers at the DMV would totally be sloths yes so true what is your favorite part about the movie it was very funny movie, zootopia offers a thoughtful message about the state -of- the art animation what's the name of the police officer in the movie what do you think about Judy Hoops as actor in this movie? what is the rating of this movie? im sorry i completely forgot about this it looks like the rating is 8.1 out of 10 on IMDB and rotten tomates 98% so the ratings are really good The police officer is Judy Hopps right? the bunny I think the acting and animation were excellent in this movie yes he is That is so true about Zootopia having characters look beyond sterotpes sterotypes and assumptions yes so true thats funny carnivores eat herbivorous because it is in their nature very true did you like this movie I loved this movie did you watched before? I have watched it quite a bit yes have you what is the names of the characters? Judy is the bunny cop and Nick is the sly fox is that right I love when she asks Nick, the fox to join the ZPD as her new partner yes, judy, Manchas , Otterton Do you usually watch animations yes sometimes what is night howlers? I remember that part with night howlers they are the toxic flowers that made all the mammals messed up where did they find Doug? yes right In the laboratory hidden in the city subway does judy quit her job

i am a teacher too . what subject do you teach ? wesome ! i teach english , but i really want to be an established writer
hanks ! what are you up to this weekend ?
well , what is your qualification ?
What is the name of the movie? It is the Imitation Game. Have you seen it? I have not. Who is staring in the movie? The four main stars are Benedict Cumberbatch, Keira Knightley, Matthew Goode, and Tom Goodman-Hill I like Keira Knightley and Tom Goodman-Hill. Is it an action movie? It is a historical drama and it is based on a real life cryptanalyst Alan Turing. It gets excellent ratings. I am not sure what a cryptanalyst does. Will people who don't know be able to follow the story? The critical reviews say that it is written well and that Benedict Cumberbatch does a great job of portraying Turing so it sounds like anyone would still be able to follow the story. You are probably right. Benedict Cumberbatch is a popular actor. What time period does the movie take place? It takes place during World War II because Turing decrypted German intelligence codes for the British government during that war. I did not know that. I wonder since it is a WWII movie it is violent or if they will only show the decryption related scenes?
but not heights , right ? when i was young , i loved iced tea too .
hat sounds nice ! i spend a lot of time at the park reading and walking . yes , i remember reading a whole book in the park in 2011 . o way ! do you like singing ? we should be friends ! i sing to myself , but the only time i had a good voice was boy soprano ! w you must have been so cute ! yes , i was . where do you live ? in the u . s . ?

This movie also has a very well-developed plot line that keeps its viewers hooked and allows children to resonate with it because most kids have toys similar to the ones in this movie. I can't imagine anybody else playing him I agree. Without him, the movie would not be the same Do you generally watch movies with ratings as high as this one? Not this high so I guess I am a little surprised that this movie got such a high rating. I think this movie targets children and attempts to correct feelings of jealousy and anger they may have towards their friends and/or siblings

i just cannot stand hangovers , hence why i do not drink ! football is great . between practice and work and everything , i never have time for my pet iguana named sophocles . hat is so rad . i will hangout with him if you do not have time .
I just noticed it features Lacey Chabert, who was the original voice of Meg from Family Guy and then she disappeared Oh, really? That's interesting! I never saw that. I think it's interesting there is a character named Janis Ian, who sang a song, "Seventeen," about being excluded socially, so it's kind of "like the movie," if yu know what i mean. Are you seeing a one page document? I thought there would be 3 pages
what are you reading ? i am great i just read the great gatsby again . . . . hat definitely is a great one . are you tall ?
He tried to break out with his usually style. He was not very welcomed by critics. Eternal Sunshine was good. That is one of my all-time favorite movies. I'm not too sure about how well it was critically acclaimed, but I enjoyed. Yes. I was very good. Bruce Almighty was also good. The scenes with Jenifer Aniston were very funny. She too is someone who can not seem to get out of her cast type. Steve Carell also is a wonderful dramatic actor. I haven't seen many Steve Carrell movies.... is he good in comedies?

If I remember correctly, the paper was run by her family, so she sort of had an advantage. :) Is it considered a historical film, drama? It is considered as such. It is based on the true story of whether or not the press had the freedom to publish things of this nature, and whether the government could take actions to suppress the press. Wow, this definitely sounds like a movie I would be interested in watching. Can you tell me anything else about the movie you feel is important The movie received strong reviews... Rotten Tomatoes gave 88% and 7.9/10 CinemaScore gave an A Ultimately, and despite being threatened to receive criminal charges from the government, Streep's character decides to run the story. I love a strong movie where even despite the negative they go ahead and do what they feel is right. This definitely happened here
Ohh that’s neat

Yes it’s a 2010 drama The director is David fincher do you know him ? Not familiar. Rotten tomatoes gave it 9/10.  I think it’s a 10 I'm shocked it got 96% It’s a b plus too ? It stars Jesse einsienberg .. do you follow him ? He plays mark Yeah. I think that is a pretty high score for a documentary film No. But he did great in this movie Andrew Garfield is good in this he plays Eduardo .. do you like him ? Yeah he is pretty good Justin Timberlake is my favorite he plays sean I love that it all started when Mark got dump by his girlfriend. Yeah I like him too. It’s a tale of sex money genius and betrayal It’s also based on bens 2009 book The film isn’t about the start of Facebook and lawsuits It was consaidered the movie of the year Hmm is that so? I thought it revolves around that plot How Facebook started It was and non of the actors had any say in the movie It’s suppose to a dark view of it Part fiction and part biographical Interesting, I wish it was pure biographical though IT takes liberties with its subject Agree.

Wonder woman was awesome, and was a hast introduction to the character. Well it was her first full length movie. I think using love to fight war is the same old thing. The woman leaving her home to be with the man is the same old thing that always happens in movies

reen and what is yours ?
He had to hide his sexuality. He didn't have a choice. Yes, I think it was extremely important to be included in the movie because that was a central theme to his own life. Do you think he proposed marriage to make sure the project would get completed under him without anyone finding out? Yes, I think that was the reason. Why do you think it got such a low score from certain critics and others rated it highly? I think some might have had a problem with the liberties taken. Do you think it was fair for Menzies to require them to destroy their work after the war? No, I don't think it was fair because they should have kept it for future generations to be able to look at and study.
Is there a point where I can take a break from watching it?  Like an intermission? I don’t believe so no

No, I have not seen this movie, what is it about? It's a superhero film based on the Marvel team of heroes, it's about the team of heroes, Iron man, Captain America, the Hulk, and Thor, and their objective is to stop Thor's brother, Loki, from endangering Earth. It's pretty well received, and has a good sense of humor in my opinion. What do you think? It sounds like a good movie, who does it have in it? Robert Downey Junior plays Iron man, Chris Evans is Captain America, and Chris Hemsworth is Thor. Scarlett Johansson is also in the film. I like Robert Downey a lot, he was great in Iron man. Do you find that the movie is true to the comic? I am unfamiliar with the comic, however, I know that it tells some of the origin story of the team of the Avengers, so that would be the point to compare. Do we have to start a new conversation about something else? I am not getting a new documents, however, I want you to know that if you are going to consider seeing the film, it has a metacritic score of about 70, but a 92% on rotten tomatoes, so it's received pretty well. Additionally, Hawkeye is in the movie. What do you think of that for your response? We are at 8 of 12. Who is Hawkeye? I am not a huge fan of superhero movies, other than Spider-Man I believe hawkeye is an archer of sorts, wielding a bow. Additionally, the film has lots of humor, and Iron Man is a big player in this. That's good, as I said I like Iron man. Who else is in this movie besides Robert Downey?
The plot deals with criminal mastermind Lex Luthor manipulating Batman into a preemptive battle with Superman, whom Lex Luthor is obsessed with defeating. Would you like to know how the moving was rated? Sure, how was this movie rated? Rotten Tomatoes gave the movie a 27% and average rating of 4.9/10. Metacritic Score gave the movie a 44/100 rating. Lastly, CinemaScore gave the movie a B rating. Wow. Do you know why this movie got such low ratings? One of the critical responses by a fan stated, "better than Man of Steel but below the high bar set by Dolan's Dark Knight." Therefore many believe that the movie could have been a lot better. I can see that. Even though I haven't seen the movie, I don't personally see Ben Affleck as right for the role of Batman. How did people rate the role of Superman? I am not sure about that but a key scene for the movie is when Batman realizes that Superman has become a controversial figure and sees him as an existential threat to humanity. I like this scene because this is when the "beef" between the two superheroes first begin
oo humid for sure . i keep my hair cut short . this month it is pink . rita hayworth ? wait your hair is pink ? that is cool . yeah i love rita hayworth . yeah for september anyway . maybe blue for october , november , and december . do you swim ?
lmao i hope this was true haha, one thing I do not get is how the kid have enough times to prepare all those traps in the movie while they make the burglars look so dumb and pitiful or why they were even chasing the kid if they only wanted to steal stuff just take the money and jewellery and go pride got them
I thought it was a great movie, but based on this article I wouldn't recommend it if this was all I knew about it. There was a guy years back that sold the Brooklyn bridge every week for 30 years... I believe anything now.

I don't see how any parents can forget their kids at home when they are going on vacation. That seems a little far fetched. I agree, but I think it becomes slightly more believable when there's such a big group of them and you're freaking out about catching flights. They overslept because the power went out and their alarm clocks reset. That would not have happened if they had cell phones. Oh, nowadays it's almost impossible to get left behind like that. Poor kid getting made fun of by his family and then they leave him. To be fair, he was being a bit obnoxious as well. What 8 year old isn't? The whole family flying to Paris. I wonder how much the tickets cost! That was one of my biggest questions: what job did the dad have that he can afford to pay for TWO families to fly to Paris for Christmas? Not to mention how enormous their house is. The mom rides home with the Polka band. I don't think that's safe. But I guess it was the 90s. That's true! I forgot about that Also, Chicago is like the most unsafe place for that poor kid to be alone. It seriously is! Was it less dangerous in the 90s? Maybe a little but I'd say still not safe for a kid. But I guess no one can compete with an 8 year old and some booby traps lol Apparently they called it a "sadistic festival of adult-bashing" How clever and insightful
