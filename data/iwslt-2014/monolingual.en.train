It was odd to see Tim McGraw as an actor.  I'm used to seeing him as a singer Yes seen his name on the list and thought I knew it from music too So did you like the plot of a woman taking in a foster child that becomes a football player? Actually, Lily Collins who played Collins Tuohy is the daughter of Phil Collins. It was uplifting and a little cheesy all at the same time but it was a good movie

Yeah....and is hilarious how they talk about rabbit female discrimination Seems like a good holiday movie haha.... that couple Hopps and Bogo are kind of cool I like the message that they want people to look past stereotypes Yeah good message, and a rabbit cop is cute. Sounds like it will be a good comedy. Do you like this kind of comedy? I think it will be different but cute. What about you do you like comedy? Just a little bit, comedy is not my favorite. That is understandable.  Bunnyburrow is a cute name for a town. I love when Manchas "get savage" hahaha so funny did you liked that part? That part was funny and then Judy saves the day yeah, and then Judy learns that Nick was bullied as a child.... thats kind of sad That is and it is true to life so people can relate to it . when Lionheart and the others are arrested and Bellwether becomes Mayor is awesome. Yes, I like that they hide them so the scientist can find out why they are acting the way they are . Did you liked that Judy and Nick became friends at the end? Yes I think lots of people will like the healthy ending happy Yeah, I like what Ginnifer Goodwin did with Judy A really nice movie for kids. Yes and I like that they did this movie so it would be appealing to all audiences. Exactly, you can watch it with family and and enjoy. And it shows that people still want to be police officers when they grow up Hahaha.... yes! But I think that the cute puppies and animals make the police look more cute! I agree with you . I think this movie will overall be a fun, cute, family movie Yes, I think comedy is most of the times for all the family And the characters will keep young children entertained

I doubt it's a romance. Is it more of a thoughtful film? Just a first guess. Not a romance. It is a drama about the Post trying to publish the Pentagon Papers. Word. Have you watch that movie? Yes. It is about the 30 year tenure the US had in the Vietnam War. Tom Hanks was always a great actor. Streep is a fantastic actor, as well. Why don't you tell me about the directors? It was directed by STephen Spielburg; enough said. I think I've missed the Spielburg culture. Sad face That's okay though. I'll watch it whenever it is on TV. I don't know if I have ever seen it on TV. Me either! It hs a great cast of supporting actors, as well! I actually want to see inside Hollywood. It got a lot of acclaim. Do you know where it airs? I do not but keep your ears and eyes open. It's to go to go into hiding for long. Okee Dokee Do you find it odd that Tom and Meryl don't have any chemistry together

hat is what my girlfriends tell me before they begin to hate my guts .
He was an interesting character in my opinion. I liked the whole ex hitman trying to get out of his criminal past storyline. I thought the movie was well done overall. What did you think of the story? I liked that the motivation to get back into the criminal underworld was the death of his wife, puppy and a stolen car. Yeah, the revenge plot was good. I actually think it's an interesting twist. Other movies would have the main character be scared of the odds, but in this film, everyone is scared of John. How would you rate the movie from 1 to 10? I think I would give it a 9 out of 10 because it sounds like a really good movie I personally give it a full 10/10, it was a very refreshing film considering all the junk that gets released. It's hard to believe it's been 4 years since it came out. Do you think the rotten tomatoes score was too low? I do think it was too low, I dont know how they came up with that score because it was such a good movie I don't know either, for some reason rotten tomatoes gives terrible movies high scores and great movies low scores. Kind of hard to trust their opinion What did you think of the villains in the movie? I think Viggo was my favorite. I agree I like that character too since John worked for him previously How did you think Keanu Reeve did? I thought he really brought the character to life, and was super believeable/ I think he did a great job, it makes you want to see what John Wick's next move with be in another movie I agree I don't ever recall him being in a horrible movie. I hope they flesh out the movie a bit more in the coming sequels. Did you fully understand the story or did you have things that you missed? I thought it was well explained, it was a really comprehensible summary of the movie What did you think f Viggo's son? I think they did a good job of making you hate his character. I found him obnoxious for some reason.
would you give it  5 out of 5? I would. I thought it was a great film and had a very good cast. All the characters were funny in their own way and also serious when needing to be. The acting overall was great and the story was very compelling.
who is your favorite superhero i love superman but wolverine is my all time favorite both of those are great heroes . have you seen the show supergirl ? yes i have seen it it is a good show but i watch more anime than anything
no, it's a comedy no it is not Too bad. I like romantic comedies. Does being God work out for him?
Interesting! One critic said ""As the film progresses, Lex degenerates into a gibbering mad man, some strange mix ofthe Riddler and the Joker with a little bit of Mark Zuckerberg added for flair." Sorry different movie haha; I might agree to that haha. lol! Do you think people just think of Jesse Eisenberg as only Mark Zuckerberg now? lol
cool , i do to just do not have one do you exercise at all ? yes , i hike often up volcanoes i need to go take a bath . hat sounds relaxing where are you from ?
yeah that is cool , what is your favorite color ? blue i guess . yours ? i do not really like humans . ll me about it . i will not be a human much longer at least i love red , reminds me of summer time
Morgan Freeman is a perfect actor for the part. Did you see the sequel of spinoff with Steven Carrell He did Evan Almighty I feel like that was more meant for kids though Evan Almighty? I liked it better actually. I didn't think it was as good But maybe thats because I was a kid when I saw Bruce Almighty I feel like Jim Carrey was the best actor for the part Bruce learned using the power comes with responsibility and consequences. sure did A lot of memes on the internet have come from that movie Can't say yes to all prayers...not always a good thing. I thought the part with the filing cabinet was funny Yeah... And the sticky notes I have totally forgotten that Steve Carell was in this movie too... yeah he was like the better newsman or something That's right! i liked the part where jim carrey made steve carrell mess up all his words Oh, yeah, that was funny! Like he couldn't talk Pretty funny acting Yeah and the stuff he was doing to give himself better news stories
i how are you doing ? reat , just chilling with my pets . i have a cat and dog , how about you ? ice . no pets right now . i think life is too fast paced for that currently i am only ten years old so that is not a problem for me . ice ! are the pets your own ? yes , mine and my moms and dads . my mom is a school teacher . oh that is an important job . does she get much free time ? she has some free time , more than my dad , he works at a mill .

They say it is a masterpiece. Would it be appropriate for a teenager to watch it is seriously pleasurable entertainment hmm...I think it would be appropriate for a teenager. It is a love movie though. It has a lot to do with music, especially Jazz. I am not sure if teenagers like Jazz much. It was give 92% by rotten tomatoes and 8.6/10 average. She likes those romance type movies but I just need to be careful of what she see's   She also loves jazz I think I will defiantly need to rent it if it is not still in theaters. Do you happen to know if it is still in movie theaters? A major scene in the movie is when Sebastian ( Gosling) is playing jazz even though the owner warns him not to. Mia (Stone) comes in and loves it. She tries to compliment him but he rushes out very rudely. They meet months later. it was in theaters in 2016 so it probably isn't out still When they meet again she teases him and requests an 80's pop song which is offensive because he is such a good jazz artist. They hit it off afterwards though. I think we will try to find it on hulu or Netflix and see if we can stream it. Does it take place outside of the US I think it takes place in the US. Mia is trying to become an actress while Gosling is trying to become a jazz artist. They have  a hard time getting their careers started
it is my living . i like culture . hat sounds like a fun job . i am a business major but have a part time job what are you going to school for i am trying to get my ba in finance do you own your own company

I think so too. Also sad I love the League of Shadows scene. I think it's crazy he burns their temple Bruce is a bold guy He has no fear well except maybe his fear of bats lol yeah lol what do you think of this scene I find a disconnect between the League of Shadows and their desire to destroy gotham that's interesting to note i kind of agree with you it's a little random They're in Bhutan. Why do they care about an American City? I guess this is after 911 and probably resonated with movie goers This scene is scary ohh haha that's a good theory^ makes the movie seem a little weak I like that Alfred becomes a hero in this scene. yeah He's a complicated character. Old and feeble, but also a rescuer
o i am currently taking my boards for pharmacy .

I remember Robert Downey Jr from the John Hughes movies he did..I hope he is better off now than he was portrayed in those movies back in tthe 80s! Yes, he is so funny in this movie. He is the main character but Terrence Howard plays a big role as well. He plays Tony's best friend in the movie as a liasion between Tony Stark and the United States Air Force. Are we supposed to be discussing movies her? If so, are we supposed to discuss current movies or movies on the horizon? We are discussing IronMan. The superhero from Marvel. He is a normal man who is a billionaire and creates a super hi-tech suit that enables him to fly at insane speeds and shoot laser beams from his palms. Wasn't Terrance the one from Empire? With the gorgeous eyes?  He is an engima to me..do you know that the guy insists that the world is flat? Yes, that is Terrance. I just remember him from movies where he mainly played a drug addictt... One of the key scenes is when Stark is in Afghanistan promoting a new weapon. After the filming, he is in the convoy when him and his colleagues are ambushed. Stark is critically injured Robert Downey Jr I mean...I hate ot ask but am I doing this task correctly?
It's all in Russia?
mmmm , bacon . i am a barista at starbucks . since i moved her i stopped eating meat
Hello Are familiar with the movie The notebook? I have heard about it but have not seen it What is it about? Its a romance movie based on the 1996 novel with the same title by Nicholas Sparks Who are some of the actors in the film? Ryan Gosling as the main actor and Rachel McAdams Interesting. I'm a fan of his work, what are your thoughts on the movie? I actually cried when I first watch it. It is awesome. Got 52 percent in rotten tomatoes but I will give it a 100 Really? Would you say it resembles the book well? There are some changes but pretty much. I only care about the ending anyway. Ryan Gosling play as Noah in the movie, he is poor while Allie is from a rich family and she is engage with someone else but fell in love with Noah Oh wow that seems really interesting. I will have to check it out for sure. Do you know if its available on netflix? Hmm not sure. It was released year 2004 so it probably is

Do you pay much attention to critic reviews?  I feel like I do nowadays just because there's so much garbage I don't wanna waste my time.  This movie seems to have a good rating so it's prolly worth watching Yea pretty sure Turing and his research started modern computers right? I actually don't read much critic reviews, but I probably should.  I mainly use IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes, just the scores Yah I think so Definitely seems like he would have been an interesting guy I watch those guys on youtube called redletter media a lot to see what they think but mainly because they're funny Yea he would have to have been really smart to figure out those codes would be worth watching the movie just to see how he does it
I'm reading the document and I think it's true when they state, "McAdams carries much of the film's emotional weight...." She had to because she was the girl, lol yeah Its interesting they point that out I also feel that The 1940's were an interesting time, a lot was going on Yeah, it gives perspective on how they talked. How people interact with each other. How they dressed back then. people "courted" each other then. That doesn't happen too often nowadays. It was a very emotional rollercoaster. Allie's parents ban her from seeing Noah. It rarely works like that anymore
i like the color green . whats your favorite color reen . do you have a job ?
Good morning Ever seen the film 'Toy Story'? i did but i will pretend i didn't :) what year did it come out Nice one... Back in 1995, if you can believe that. who is the director?

I think it got a higher rating then it deserves I thought it was going to give us another movie to discuss I guess the movie isn't totally based on facts since it says "isn't necessarily to be believed". All i see is additional information about the same movie Yeah they took a lot of liberty telling the story It said it would have a second paragraph... I like dark irony.. A lot of the People, Places, Subject of the movie were factual but some of the "stories" within the movie I'm sure were exaggerated It's funny that he wrote badly about her on his blog, and then came up with facebook. I dont know if that was fact or just something they added to make the movie for entertaining I don't really like the name Facemash. I'm glad he changed it. Yeah that's pretty awful I wonder if it really crashed Harvard's computer network... It's amazing how quickly facebook expanded in such a short time I imagine it did with all the network traffic You see the mistake they made in the last sentence of the new paragraph looks like they accidently copied and pasted a part of the plot to another movie jesse eisnenberg stars in no, what is it? Batman v Superman the world in Superman's absence. After theyleave, the dirt atop Clark's coffin levitates. Hmmm, that's weird. Mine doesn't say that in the last paragraph another hacked performance from eisenberg strange think youll watch the movie now, after talking about it'?
it is . also an expensive one . but fashion is my thing . so it is okay ,

Oh I think I have seen Jaws like a million times since I was a kid. ha Same here. Aren't there like a few different ones? i always seem to just watch the originals I think so but the original is where it's at. I've seen a few of the sequels and they were pretty bad yesss. usually are and then I get all pissy about it. They say the original Jaws was a "scare machine that works with computer-like precision". hmm. interesting. Who could ask for anything more? yeah i guess! and i mean I guess it was pretty scary, esp for the time. I think it is funny when they catch the small tiger shark and the Mayor is all its safe now. Nope that would be too easy It really was well done. And the soundtrack. I'll have to look that up because I honestly don't even remember the music at this point aside from the shark suspense sound. ha Yes that's what I am talking about but I'm sure the whole score is great. I'm pretty sure John Williams did it. i'm so bad with names but yeah, will have to listen later How they kill Jaws in the end with the propane tank was savage.
will you watch anime with me ? i like anime
swedish , my family moved here when i was 5 i would like to go to sweden . what is it like there ? can be cold , but beautiful .

i do not . i love to shop my daughter hunts and shops for bargains . you shoot a bow ? i would like to learn oh okay . you paint or draw ?
sounds good, what the storyline? It is actually a memoir about Jordan Belfort who DiCaprio plays what do the critics say about it? The movie relates to the Stockmarket and the highs and lows that are involved while working in the market Rotten tomatoes gave it a 7.8/10 sounds pretty good It does One critic actually said it was irresponsible glorification rather than a satirical takedown did anyone not like it? On CinemaScore it was given a C as a grade Metacritic Score wasn't too bad with 75% would you recommend it? I would! I think it is an interesting storyline and the fact that it is based on true events makes it even more interesting to watch yea i wouldnt mind watching it if i had the time The cast is actually pretty famous overall I think Margot Robbie does well as DiCaprios romantic partner in this movie would you recommend it for kids?
Hello! Hi there. How are you today? I'm great thanks. Just finished watching an awesome comedy Really? Which comedy? The movie is called Home Alone, i don't know if you've seen it I have I like it very much Well it did receive a CinemaScore of A Really? That’s great But CinemaScore’s reviews are never really that good in my opinion.. Well its rotten tomatoes score was 62% Well, yeah. RottenTomatoes is always very harsh with the reviews. Which one do you think is more fair? Cinemascore’s or RT’s? Personally i would have give in it an A like the cinemascore Right I’d give it a B really Especially with such a good cast like Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern Have you seen any other films with them? Yeah a few, but i think this one was special because Chris Columbus Directed it. Well, I didn’t know that. That really is an interesting fact. One of the most memorable scenes was when Kate discovers that Kevin is missing while on the plane. Yeah? I mostly remember the pranks The thing with the heated doorknob and so on. i remember it, i also liked when she was travelling with a Polka band A polka band? Well, I don’t really remember anything about a polka band. It was when a guy overheard the mother and he offered to take the mother with him Well, it seems like I’m gonna have to rewatch the film. Do you know how long it is?
i think i should take my little sister with me

Those kinds of stories sound cliche but they're always great to watch anyway. one of the voices is done by craig ferguson - he's one of my favorite comedians. any the main character's name is Hiccup which is kind of funny. I didn't know Craig Ferguson was in it, that's cool! Are there any other famous actors in it? gerard butler, jay baruchel, jonah hill, america ferrera, kristin wilig, and christopher mintz-plasse critics rated it 74/100 Wow I didn't realize it had all those people. 74/100 is pretty good for an animated movie I'd think Critics can be uptight and not appreciate animation. on rotten tomatoes it even has a 7.9/10. so i guess lots of people enjoyed it. Yeah that's good. I feel like Rotten Tomatoes gives good estimates. Have you seen the sequel? no; i haven't. :-( i'm gonna put it on my list, though. :-) the main character is a a scrawny kid and his dad happens to be the village chieftain. so i wonder if he bulks up any. lol. the dragon's name is toothless. so it's got good comical bits in there. Haha maybe! That sounds like a good relatable conflict to have in a movie though. I bet a lot of kids can relate to that whole living up to your parents' expectations thing. certainly. and the poor kid goes out to kill the dragon in the beginning but just can't bring himself to do it. Does he start out with his own dragon or does he earn one? he befriends the one he doesn't kill and lets go. his wing was hurt and he ends up making him a prosthetic so he can fly again.
i how are you doing hello , i am doing pretty good
When you see it, remember that it gets very complex, especially when they are in "limbo". Basically, they are in their own subconscious and can't escape, especially since they may forget that they are in a dream.least that works for you well for now and knowing that i am getting my nursing degree helps . how do you like it

They send out a police chief with a marine biologist and professional shark hunter. It sounds good though, it was made in 1974 right? Matt Hooper, Murray Hamilton as Larry Vaughn, the mayor of Amity Island, and Lorraine Gary as Brody's wife, Ellen. This is the cast Yes it was in 74 and still holds up today wow that seems like quite a long time ago, do you have any movies that are similar you could recommend? The remake that was made years later would be a good option Have you read the book? how does the book hold up to the movie? Sharknado if you want more of a ridiculous comedy version I have never read the book but Im sure it holds more to offer than the movie does in suspense yeah thats probably true, have you ever personally seen the movie? I have only seen the remake of the movie and it was really good. So i am sure with Spielberg directing it was great. Yeah spielberg is pretty great, are you also a fan of his other films?
do you like italian food at all o but i can recite movie scripts in my sleep on sundays .

It gets very low scores by various rating sites like Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic That’s true And Ben Affleck is in it, so that's another reason not to watch it Critics and fans alike didn’t like it. Hahaha I don’t like Ben A. either. The only DC movie I’ve liked so far is Suicide Squad. The critics really didn't like it either. They say it "isn't fun" and that it's a long movie without much substance It does have a pretty good cast though, especially Amy Adams and Jesse Eisenberg It’s long, I’ll give you that. But I found it thrilling. Don’t forget Cavill Henry Cavill Yeah, so I haven't actually seen it, but I do know that it got bad reviews Aren’t you even interested in seeing it? If you want to understand JLA you’ll have to see it. Well, I don't hate the idea of it, but from what I know of the superheroes in the story, it doesn't really make much sense to me that Superman and Batman would want to fight What's JLA? Justice League The movie It’s a bad adaptation from the comics Oh right. I guess I've lost my interest in a lot of superhero movies. I used to be a big fan, but they're kind of redundant
i went there when i was only 14 hat is young . did you drive ? i hate driving .
where did you work ?
she is an artist . she paints with my favorite colors , red and blue . well my mom was a music teacher . very cool . i love music which is why i love to visit cities with piano bars . hat is good , my go to movie is the las of the mohicans reat movie . do you travel ? i would love to see ireland or puerto rico . i like to . no i have never been . maybe one day .
Yes....she always plays her part to a t ! I liked Jesse Eisenberg as Lex luther.  I wonder if they will stick with him in the future Really ?   Wow I didn't......I liked him in adventureland Zombieland for me Lol Yeh rotten tomatoes got it right with their score I've never liked the superhero vs superhero movies for some reason This one in particular, superman would just destroy batman Agreed.......he's "super" man for christs sake.  Nobody can beat superman. Except kryptonite man of course I liked Nolans "Dark Knight"  alot I agree.  I loved that trilogy. The "save martha" twist for this movie kind of killed it for me. Can't believe in this movie....Bruce Wayne saw superman as a threat....unless I was missing something Lol.....yeh me too I think he had a problem with Superman and the destruction he has caused and the future destruction he may bring. Did you like this movie better than "Man of Steel" ? Ah ok.....yeh that's right.
oh get some rest later i have a lot of fun with nature . i get my fun in piano and surfing hat sounds like fun i have trouble paying my bills , yeah , i am at a bar at the moment . its money i guess y es times are very hard i think about moving to another country . hat is not a terrible idea it is a great one yes maybe i will move down south .
oh fun stuff ! so how old are you now ? lmost 28 my ex husband is 30 h so you have been in the us for a while now . seen any concerts here ? yes one was after a italian cook off the band is called train
The film has faries and odd flora and levitating cliffs as special effects. I'm not sure if it has too much violence for kids. The main character definitely has a conflicted relationship with Aurora, and the kingdom it's set in is corrupt. Oh I got it. So it is like a fairy tale. Good to know. And what about the kingdom? The kindgom that Maleficent lives in is dark, because she turned it that way after a devastating betrayal. The human kingdom is corrupt, with a King who tries to conquer the fairy kingdom but fails. Did you know that the film received a CinemaScore of A, but a Metacritic score of 56? Do you care what ratings a movie gets, or do you base your opinions on other things?
hat is awesome ! i went to a car show .
is there a shark in it? Rotten Tomatoes rating is 97% with an average 9.2/10. what studio released it? Yes. There is a shark.

The movie was made in 2013 and the actual incident happened in the 90’s I think.
All in all I like Keanu Reeves, but I see what you are saying.  Probably the puppy and the car were meant to catch our attention. Yeah, i do wonder when the next movie is coming out though. It does say that it was the first installment. I don't know if TV is so crappy at this point we are grasping at anything.
ow old are them when they died ? my mom was 30 and my dad 35 . do you have any hobbies ? i do not have i like reading oh , i like making houses with matches . have you ever tried ? ot yet why do you love it ? it is fun to create different homes with something as small as a match . really ? i wish i can see them i usually light them on fire right after they are done so i have no pictures . sorry its ok i will just imagine them

Hey there, the movie is Superhero Drama and you should watch it because it has a rotten tomato score of 92%. Rotten Tomato is usually pretty right on with their reviews. I do love super hero movies. Whats the name of the movie? The name of the movie is The Avengers lol. It's a pretty popular movie though and has a good cast Who are someof the actors in it? Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, and Mark Ruffalo. Robert Downey Jr, he plays Iron Man, correct? Yes. Samuel Jackson is also apart of the cast. Sounds like a great cast! How long is the movie? I'm not sure how long the movie is but usually these types of movies last well over an hour. Probably around an hour and a half.

The final scenes were well praised by critics, how interesting I liked the rude goldberg machines used for the bobby traps yeah, I found those really funny when I watched. Culkin was greaT in the movie I always recognized the character played but I never knew that his name was Macaulay Culkin Referring to the actor that played the character he's pretty much only known as the home alone boy. It's odd the movie was rated so lowly It has  a CinemaScore of A but a metacritic  of 63. Thats an astute observation I enjoyed the sadistic adult bashing as a child The family left him on a trip to paris, which is funny to me

Oh very interesting!  I think Angelina played her role pretty accordingly. I wonder if they'll make a second movie. the other casting i thought was pretty good. especially the king. made the perfect villain you didnt know you would hate until you hated him. a sequel would be interesting but i dont know where they would take it. um... hello/ where did you go? i think i would have liked the movie more if someone other than elle fanning had played aurora. but that is my biased opinion i wish my partner had stayed... would have been a good conversation oh well.
Keanu Reaves is a hitman who kills a bunch of people, basically.  Because they killed his puppy. It's got an 86% Rotten Tomatoes score, so that's pretty good. Is it Point Break?  I haven't seen one of his movies in a long time. No, it's not point break.  It's newer, from 2014.   It's John Wick. Who else is in it? Alfie Allen, Adrianne Palicki, Willen Dafoe, John Leguizamo, Ira McShane, Dean Winters, Bridget Moynahanm and Michael Nyqvist. I have no idea who most of those people are honestly.  What is the plot besides killing over a dead puppy? Basically, John Wick used to be a hitman, but he retired.  Then someone made the mistake of killing his puppy, and he comes back for revenge.  It's a pretty simple vengence plot, not much to it.   It's a very distilled action movie. Do you actually see the dog die? I don't think so. I hope not.  I can't stand when animals get hurt on screen.  Humans?  KIll em all.  But animals are a big no. It mostly focuses on the action between the humans, yeah.  John Wick was basically the most badass assassin in the world before his retirement,   It's sort of a cartoonish world, where there's this entire underground culture of highly payed assassins. What happens in the end? There's a big shoot out at a church, between John Wick and the mob boss he used to work for.  The mob boss gives up the location of his son, the one who had killed John's dog, and John kills goes there and kills him.  As I said, Distilled action movie, light on plot, big on shootouts. Is there any humor? Not really.
i only eat vegan so maybe that is why i have never hear of it before ? hat might be . where are you from ? recently , well last month , i moved to sweden .
i do not have time to do that , too many dogs and cats at my place . i like dogs what kind of dogs are they wo labs and a poodle . hose are cute and friendly dogs . what do you do for a living i am actually still going to school . do you like it ? i work as in a restaurant and hate my uniform
ot really , its like dieting , you just need to stay conscious .
any good actors or voices in the movie? Idris Elba, Jason Bateman, and Ginnifer Goodwin is it in the theater or on dvd? I don't know about that but it was released in 2016. how long is the movie? what kind of animals are there?
Yes they are and very cute! yes and some very good work done by the actors I agree they played their roles very well for animation.

I also like his name, its quick to say and catchy. I love that the guy was mean to his son because he knew what he did and knew he was in trouble. I liked that he got punched and throws him out when he finds out who the car was stolen from John. I love that his revenge is based on principal and not on just money or drugs, he is doing it for a reason close to himself. Yes, I agree that is what makes it so good. I love how none of the other assassins can get him, like why are yall trying, he is the best for a reason! I love how he destroyed Viggo's money before he is captured. Yeah that really showed him who was boss didnt it? I love how John let Viggo get the upper hand, but it was just a trick so he could murder him. Yes, and the fist fight at the dock was intense.   Then he was stabbed. It is great and wonderful turnaround.
i like to hike which is why my vacation home is ideal . i wish i could get out more what do you do for work ? i stay home taking care of the kids
i . just got back from horseback riding . what are you up to ? well , i just got back from the golden arches ! you are making me hungry . think i will get a slice a cheese to nibble . i have no clue what that is , but i went to the beach today ! cheese , like dairy . the beach sounds great ! oh , i see ! i wish i had a house on the beach ! i do not blame you . although i have to watch out for shellfish , i am allergic . do you ? i love listening to music on the beach ! dancing at concerts is a favorite of mine . lso , my parents came with me , because they are on a break from teaching ! fun ! i help children too . i work at a nonprofit . what kind of music do you like ? i like pop !

So do you like dramas? Yeah there ok but I like comedy’s better Why do you think this is called a biological drama if no one from face book helped in the project I usually do too. But I decided to watch this movie because Justin Timberlake is in it I was actually asking myself that. To me it is not a biographical movie. No I don’t think is it seems that you would have to talk to the people who run Facebook to find out about what’s going on

who was the cinematographer? The document doesn't say. But in one scene he pulls the moon closer for his love interest. and he makes ducks fly in the formation of  a heart.
It was well reviewed, but the ratings given by rotten tomatoes and metacritic are 78% and 75/100 respectively. That's not too bad. Can you tell me more about Jordan Belfort's lifestyle? Does it crash down on him?
www , sounds fun . i have a little girl too , she is 16 months . how nice , what do you do for work ? i actually play guitar in a band ! we do weddings and local events , you ? i am a trauma surgeon at a local hospital oh wow , that must be a challenging but rewarding job . it is actually . are you married ?

Justin Timberlake plays him so well too. I never knew about it either, but keep in mind it's based off the book. Who knows how much he actually was involved. That is true. I wonder if Mark Zuckerberg actually invited Sean Parker to live at Facebook headquarters!
i am great ! i just drove my prius . how are you ? vironmentally friendly and cool i just finished a delicious keto meal . . . ! low carting it i see . i just had tofu tiki masala , but i do not care for tofu . o pain no gain . you seem very disciplined with your diet plan . i like that ! i try to be . i work for a big law firm what do you do ? i wish ! if only my lsat scores were above 150 i would be there too . circus !
i like to try and stay in shape as much as i can hat is good . being physically fit is healthy to the mind too . so how many kids have you got sandy ? 2 kids sons and they can be handful and raising them myself .
What do you think of DiCaprio's character? Do you view him as a good or bad guy at the start of the movie? I saw him as the good guy.  I really liked him. What did you think of how they made the inside of the dreams look? Do you think this will be something that one day science can do? I never seen anything like it really, i thought it was great. I doubt anything like that will exist in our time. I wasn't surprised, were you, that the businessman wanted to use it for really bad reasons.  I can't see a good way to use this. Corporate espionage doesn't sound like something a good guy would do, would it? NO, you're right about that. But otherwise, he seemed like a nice guy.  I wonder why he chose this line of work! Did you look at the movies as a romantic film or more of an action film? Oh, I only saw it as an action film.  I understand the bits about his...romantic parts. Do you think Ellen Page did well as Ariadne? What did you think about the whole airplane thing?  That was crazy. It blew my mind that each person working in the dream was a creator of one of the dreams that they were in.  I wonder how they kept it all straight while they were dreaming.
i i have been wondering who will join me on my nature trip ? i would like to go . anything to get out of this small boring town . hat is good but i do not have enough money and i am in debt right now . i am in debt too . i am a stand up comedian and its real hard to find work hat is bad we should go somewhere else how about a electronic music festival ? i like some electronic music but not all because a lot of it is fake . yes like my fake fantasy with living in another country i always wanted to live in another country but i am stuck in a small boring town . why ? if you want we should live together in nature because its free . small town like this is not good for anything except gossiping yes i know comedians also like gossiping do you like it ? sometimes but everything is so politically correct and that ruins most jokes .
So it's and adventure type movie?
hi Hi what do u think about the wolf of wall street? I liked it a lot. I'm surprised at the reviews only being  70% . What did you think of the movie ? i liked the movie a lot as well i consider 70% pretty good since rotten is pretty harsh on criticism for movies it was very funny and fresh I'm surprised by the critical response claustrophobia in scope,  I felt the movie explored a wide range of topics oh the critical response is horrible none of the characters were even dull to begin with I agree the "irresponsible glorification" was what made the movie funny Yes I agree, the movie was funny because of this I feel like the movie was somewhat realistic oh totally the scene where jordan learns that a stockbroker's only job is to make money for himself is what started his whole binge its like he matched his talent with the system by exploiting it I think the movie was very believable because of this, the main character was poised to get involved in a money making scheme Do you recognize all actors listed in the document ? yea basically everybody jordans pump and dump scheme was very savvy I feel like the scheme could have went on longer if he didn't alert the FBI thats cuz he made 22 mil in 3 hours smh Also he had an affair which could also contribute to his eventual downfall he was lucky to marry naomi who has a british aunt that they could exploit his affair was the best thing to happen to him imo Yes that's true that was how he was able to hide the money wow i forgot he got caught because someone snitched
you would really like it

Yes, I do And I’ve seen it as well Have you? Oh wow, so you know a lot. Yes! What was your favorite part? When they win the scare games, I guess... I don’t really remember much tbh Yours? I don't know that I really have a favorite part. I just like the way it was put together and the overall spirit of the movie. Very fun and cute! You’re right about that. It’s definetely fun and lighthearted Definitely. I think I liked the other Monsters movies more but this one was super fun.
Completely agree there Clint does bring his own type of superpowers though to his scenes. I also thing Samuel L. Jackson pulled off Director Fury really well. The effects were Grade A to say the least. Loki has the smug attitude though that makes you want them to get him in the end.
i ! how are you ? i am doing fine today . i am ok i guess . life is rough since my dig died . how are you ? i am sorry to hear about your dog . i am just trying to find the beauty in the rest of the world , looking into my yard . when my dog died i looked for comfort by reading the bible . hat is a popular one . i find inspiration on earth , then make art to reflect it . what kind of art ? i love traveling to different museums . sculpture . i like to use my hands . ow that my wife and i have retired we have more time to travel . hat sounds like a lot of fun . have you been anywhere that stands out ? we went to the vatican which was very inspirational .

so your boat will sink ?
i am happy for you ! what else do you enjoy ?
unfortunately no , with the long hours its hard to keep pets
its mans triumph over nature .
Hey! Have you seen this movie? Yes, I've seen it recently and I was absolutely amazed by it. Have you? really? I'm actually not a fan. And if so, did you like it? Well, why not? I really enjoyed the cast, especially Henry Cavill as Superman and Ben Affleck as Batman, Ben Affleck will never be Batman in my eyes! lol You have a point as well, I guess. What did you think about the plot of the movie? couldn't understand it? what about you you still there? Well, after many events, Superman became a controversial figure and people started to kind of fear him. You add the vigilante part of Batman and you get yourself a battle. Also, I enjoyed the portrayal of Lex Luthor by Jesse Eisenberg.
i am sorry ! heres something happy . i am getting a new car ! mines so old ! over 20 years ! i do not even care about that . hmmm heres something else happy . i am going back to college because i did not finish i am a student too hat is cool ! what do you do with your free time ? any favorite movies ? i play music . i could play you a song do you know any songs from the last of the mohicans ? its my favorite movie i play music . i could play you a song

I'm not sure. I liked how that was when Mia first heard Sebastian sing and was truly moved by it. I think it was interesting way to initiate their relationship yeah, it was just sad how he brushed her off, since things could've been different I do like how the next time Mia sees Sebastian he is also singing. I also liked how she kind of teased him by requesting a song she knew he would hate to sing do you usually watch musicals? Occasionally. I also enjoyed the development of Sebastian and Mia's relationship, such as when Mia decides to begin writing a play all by herself because Sebastian suggests it to her. I feel like the two of them really grow as individuals when they get into a relationship I enjoyed that part too, since it also shows how hard both of them are working to achieve their dreams they both want to become successful in their separate areas, but they have to struggle a lot
yes actually . i mostly take the subway now . i like talking to the travelers there . ice do you ever cook i order out . what do you like to do ?
i know thank you for the good advice i am a nervous person . you can over come that if you want to . it is hard buy i will try it soon . i enjoy drinking budweiser .
yea I saw that gooey and over the top Actors are blessed by good material! I doubt it yea every every movie needs some comedy.... The ratings are disappointing. ye only 5 stars out of 10 But the critical response seems to say it's a must see movie. yea it doea at THt I rarely cry but critical response says everybody cries that watches the movie. Makes me want to see what's all about. yea the hype is big but the ratings are low
Exactly. Judy hopps being portrayed as a bunny was an amazing choice. It really highlight the way society can view people. She even overcame hardships and was valedictorian but because of who or what she was, they still placed her in parking duty. I really liked when judy learned that Nick was bullied as a child. She realizes that all types of people have been through hardships. I like that they portrayed her as a flawed character who even though she was the main hero, still struggled with stereotyping. The moment when she realized that nick wasn't all bad was one of the key highlights in the film. Even the best people still have problems, and thats ok, we just need to work on them together. Yes, the ultimate message of the movie was about being inclusive. We all do need to work together. Again, such an intense topic but the movie did a great job of being entertaining and humorous throughout.
blue is best , though . i always go for blue whenever i can .
same here . i am a yoga instructor i am a high school football coach . i played all through college . hat is wonderful . i have always loved yoga . i love having a healthy lifestyle i could never do those poses , drives me nuts , lol yea it can be a little difficult at times lol i am a pretty big guy so those things are not so friendly to me what do you like to do in your free time ?
Right! Such a clever little boy. I think any kid left alone would freak out the touching part was when he goes to the church and meets that old man who reunites with his estranged son How shocked his mom was when she realized they left him home. I know, she freaks out and then tries to catch any available flight back She knew something was wrong but couldn't put her finger on it. Like a mother's intuition. That's true though, mothers always know They sure do. And the trouble she takes to get home I think I may just watch this movie again on DVD
Hahahahaha trueeeee Looks like critics didn't rate it very well though
cool , i was thinking the same thing . we are so alike
well that is not fair , but you gotta do what you gotta do
do you think you are going to break up with him ? i am not sure i do not ever go the extra mile anymore it seems like you are not that into him anymore .

i had 5 , but 2 died sadly wow that is terrible , what happened ? i like to grow sunflowers
this movie is animation based and its a comedy movie but also awesome graphics that would entertain any kids that sounds pretty interesting. do you know any of the storyline of the movie? yes, a man who delights in all things wicked, supervillain Gru (Steve Carell) hatches a plan to steal the moon. Surrounded by an army of little yellow minions and his impenetrable arsenal of weapons and war machines, Gru makes ready to vanquish all who stand in his way. But nothing in his calculations and groundwork has prepared him for his greatest challenge: three adorable orphan girls (Miranda Cosgrove, Dana Gaier, Elsie Fisher) who want to make him their dad. wow steve carell and miranda cosgrove are some pretty big names in this film. little yellow minions sure can attract the views of a child, which is why i see why you said the movie would entertain any and all kids. is gru successful in stealing the moon? yes he did successfully stole the moon but Do you generally watch movies with (good/bad) ratings? i try to look beyond the ratings if i want to see the movie. but yes typically so ok the ratings are Rotten Tomatoes:81% and average: 6.8/10 Metacritic Score: 72/100 CinemaScore: A rotten tomatoes having a score of 81% is pretty high! the movie must be very highly liked among lots of people
yeah ! he is a straight a student . do you have any children ? clever boy then ! yes , i have two who are big into sports .
It got an "A" CinemaScore. The movie also received a score of "A" on CinemaScore. It did! Also 70/100 on MS It's tells of Bruce Wayne's journey to becoming Batman. It was produced in 2005. I liked Morgan Freeman. I like Christian Bale. Christian Bale was good as Batman, and Michael Caine is good as Alfred. I think he is Christian Bale is a great actor. He performs well, particularly in this movie. In this movie, Batman burns down the Temple. I don't remember that part, but do you typically like SuperHero movies? I don't think he did it for revenge. Not really into it. I think this movie is a bit better than the comic-book. What do you think? I typically don't like these kinds of movies either, but I think the ratings are about correct.  I enjoyed seeing Bruce train and learn how to confront injustice in the world. Christian Bale should play more comic-books movies. I think he played as Batman well. Christopher Nolan is one of my favorite writer/director. I'm not a big fan of Christopher Nolan.
In my view it would be 9.5 That is fair considering you like the animated movies. When Woody was jealous for Andy preference to Buzz he was really hard knocking him right? Yes, I was surprised how much the toys fought over Andy. There were a lot of hidden messages in the film, but I am not sure many people caught on to them.
I do not think so. It's based on Sleeping Beauty not Snow White, my mistake.
yeah i like sports . what do you like to read ? i enjoy memoirs . i can relate to stories about families . do you have a big family ? i live with my grandparents and my cat , mater . i have a small family , but they are so important to me . i like to cook with my grandma . our specialty is pizza ! she is great .

r abigail , she is my best friend ever ! ! ! h , that is cute . do you live in the town or countryside ? in the town where tomorrow is the first safety patrol day ! !
OMG I know.  It totally made me cry.  Plus Hiccup is amazing for all his inventions.  I love that he keeps trying even though they backfire.  He doesn't give up. His inventions are really cool, it's interesting to see such innovation in a kid's movie, it's a good example to set for younger kids. He's definitely a great example and totally relateable to the the awkward middle school kids who aren't doing what they would like to do I love that he named the dragon Toothless, it's such a cute name for a fearsome dragon. It was really clever.  You would assume by his name that his issue was with his teeth and not his crippled fin

Yes they are perfectionists probably.   A lot goes into it even by hollywood standards. Who were some of the voice actors? Mike Wazowski, the green monster, was done by Billy Crystal John Goodman was the blue monster, Sully Who was the voice actress for the Principal? or dean rather Helen Mirren I dont know what else she was in but she did sound familiar Well a lot of big names in the voice actors indeed. Billy Crystal and John Goodman are the main actors that I recognize It's hard to imagine any other actor doing their roles
Since he was also a predator he took offence to that since he wanted to be a member of the junior scouts in his old neighborhood but they attacked him and put a muzzle on him and treated him like a criminal.

I dont know it does not state it Is it rated "R"? or PG-13? but it got 86 % from rotten tomatoes I dont know that either sorrt its got shooting and sex Probably R then. it is a mind boggler I might have to check it out. I love thrillers. Anything else I should know to make a decision? no the movie is really great. The less you know the better done? I think we both need to have 12 lines of covo Ok...done. so 24 lines total? I am not able to scroll back up to review though.

Sulley comes from a family of scarer's and it is expected that he will be a good scary monster when he finishes school so he has some pressure on him. He feels like he has to prove himself, but he's not very good at school. Oh great Does he actually become successful? He joins a group of misfit monsters in a fraternity called Oozma Kappa. Mike is apart of that fraternity. They are nice monsters, but not very scary. Well there is a big challenge that all the fraternity's participate in. Whoever wins gets a trophy and all. Mike and Sulley, and the rest of Oozma Kappa want to win so that they will prove themselves to be the scariest monsters. Sulley is not a very good team player at first though. Oh alright So this challenge consists of different tasks And to complete it they have to use different strategies

Yes, a classic, I'd agree. It is an oldie. No, I am a bit surprised. I like the humor in this movie. Yeah it surprisingly got lower ratings. Macaulay is a great actor in this movie, for being so young. I think he does a great job. The boobie traps are hilarious.

I would not have thought it was based on a book. Interesting, maybe I will find the book prior to reading it. I don't know the actual running time. I was engaged throughout the entire movie. The last few scenes were intense! I just found out that it was a book. I'd also like to read it to compare. HMM, intense, but safe for kids to watch it right? I find books generally better, but I love movies. I had no qualms letting even my youngest watch it. It's rated PG.
i work the night shift at the holiday inn here in denver hat must be very tiring
i would not object . that would look good in my portfolio .
That's what the critics claim. I agree. What did you think of the casting of Robert Shaw as Quint? interesting choice.

that could be. there are a lot of big names actors in it. seems like you couldn't go wrong with such a big star cast and that could by why they picked it apart a bit more since they had some many A list actors

Yes It's a prequel to Monsters Ince it goes back to when Mike and Sully are in college they're rivals at first but then they become friemnds friends And they're basically just going to school? Any drama? Going to University Yes, there's drama and comedy It's very true to the Monsters Inc spirit same type of feel I'll have to watch it some time.

yes-  comedy- the main plot was kind of all over the place but its been awhile since ive seen it and i cant really remember im suprised it wsnt rated very well Well, I looked it up it was produced by Pixar, and it was a prequel to Monsters Inc For the next movies is always hard to get a good appreciation from the critics I think it is quite cute how the movie portrayed how people dream about their future, in the case of Mike Wazowski Going to the company and then years later finally getting into the university to fulfill his dream.
hi here im sorry I like romantic drama however, this movie seemed more drama It was also very fantasized Who was Daisy again?

Definitely Tom Hardy. What about you? I liked the way harry styles played as Alex personally. Did you agree with the rating of the movie? Definitely one of my top of the year. What did you think of the beach scene? It was kind of explicit It was, but I feel like most of Nolan's movies have that element so I was expecting it. Do you like Christopher Nolan's movies in general? I haven't seen many others actually by him, this was my first but I plan on seeking some out, any suggestions? Most of his movies are really good. He did the Dark knight. What about Dunkirk did you find the most interesting? I found the way he portrayed the war to be so unique. It felt like i was in the movie, what about you? I agree. I also appreciated how accurate the movie was. How did you feel about the scene where Mr. Dawson and Peter use their boat to go rescue stranded soilders? I thought it was powerful, especially when George became blind from his head injury, it was so ugly.

So frozen was released in 2013 It got a pretty good rotten tomatoes rating Frozen was released in 2013 and released by Disney Pictures. No, it did not. It was the best animated musical Disney released. Kristen Bell played Anna's role really well. Frozen is a great film, do you know that it was inspired by one of Hans Christian Andersen tales? Hey, you were right about the "rotten tomatoes rating". I looked it up and did see that they were dinged. Do you like Animated films? What about 3D animated film? those are my favorites.
i have always wanted kids . that is great that you can share it with younger folks . yes , i will just say its a trend or something , they will find it on youtube i am sure ! haha ! hey usually do . ll . kids .

Oh he fell into a dry well Are you referring to Bruce as a child? Said Joe Chill murdered his parents. Yes, but only because they were outside at a bad time because Bruce (as a kid) was scared of the "bats" in a show I'm quite surprised this movie received a score of A on CinemaScore. I can believe it. I like how you can actually relate to the arguments of the villians, like Gotham City being deserving of a purge
do you like technology ? i think the new things are awesome . i am good with computer and cell phones cool ! i love adding lists of gadgets to new websites i make .
not really I thought it was kind of bad I see Rotten Tomatoes rated it as 27%... Hmmm...the actors are good, but I guess the story line was bad? It was just hard for poeple to follow if you didn't know anything about comics. ben was a terrible batman. Like me-clueless about super heroes and comics... it was just so random and the story was everywhere Yeah, I just don;t see Ben Affleck as batman Bad casting they could of done so much with it, but failed I think this movie would be for a very narrow audience-like comic-loving teens I think disney bought dc so we should see something good out of that. true that could be a major improvement I don't think anyone read comics anymore that much they just go to the movies, lol Not at all, it's a digital world, people have better things to entertain themselves with And this movie's scores are just pathetic... I don;t think too many people would be interested after seeing these scores
, probably . he is a sweet lil guy who loves tuna and is not mean .
it's from 2013 Not too old I guess. So it is based on a true story? it's based on the memories of Jordan Belfort. I'm not sure if they are true or not, but it's supposed to be somewhat biographical. Yeah, it does sound like an interesting film by a good director, but reception seems mixed as you indicated. it's entertaining and funny, but it leaves you with mixed feelings depending on your moral compass Yes, I guess it is how much you can stomach in terms of personal preferences. Who stars in the movie? Leo di Caprio pays Belfort, the central character He's a great actor. then Jonah Hill has his partner one of his best performances I see. Cool! I'll put it on my watch list. Thanks for the help.
Lol! That’s so delightful! Almost like a Disney fairytale! Too bad she never got the letters thanks, but yes it's such a fairytale! Then Allie and Noah finally get back together in the old house and make love! It's so sweet!

Agreed. The Pharrell song is really catchy though What song is that? "Happy". Was a big hit! It's hard to believe it's going to be 8 years old this year. Did you know the film was animated by a French studio? I had no idea. That's pretty cool. What I do like about this movie is the fact that it's from a villain's perspective. That's different than the norm.

Hey there! Do you like Biographical Dramas with high ratings? I suppose I enjoy them on occassion. Which movie are we talking about? We're talking about the 2010 Biographical Drama "The Social Network" Who stars in it? It stars Jesse Eisenberg as Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook Are there any female leads? Nope - it's a bunch of dudes! But since it's a true story, I'm glad that they didn't introduce any female leads that weren't in the real-life story Ah, I see. Who was it directed by? It's directed by David Fincher. I think he's great and really fantastic at portraying stories. Do you like him? I'm not familiar with any of his work. Do you know of any other films he's directed? Not off the top of my head - but you could definitely look him up online!
Even though Batman was obviously the focus because it was his origin story, the other significant characters were mostly male, Gary Oldman, Liam Neeson, and Michael Cane. Yes that is true.  It says it also stars Cillian Murphy.  I do not know if that is a male or female. Still overwhelmingly male. yes agreed I am not seeing a second document I have a blank page it changed a little i think, i have it. some of the reviewrs who didn't like it talked about how they didn't like exploring the whole damaged psyche thing. Oh I see it now!  I thought it was the same thing. no mine is the same Did you like the scene where He was down the well when he was a kid? Oh i see that now.  I can see how he would develop a fear of bats! The fact that his fear of bats lead to his parents getting murdered, then turned him into Batman!  I never knew that is how he became batman! It was really sad though when his parents died. So Chill is released and he wants to get revenge on him! Chill was pretty chilling. I like how they showed his powers. It is a shame that his childhood friend said about his father being ashamed of him.  That is a low blow. interesting how he says real power comes from being feared That is a pretty horrible thing to say to an orphan. agreed! it is sad how the cops were corrupt in Gotham I thought it was pretty low that the Dr. Jonathan Crane did bad stuff like smuggle drugs. makes you not want to trust a shrink!

The bit about getting married to Keira Knightley might be annoying for you if you are not partial to her acting. I might warn you about all that. It is interesting since the movie is based on a play based on a book based on his life. I see your point there. I would probably enjoy the technical aspects of the film, the good acting, and even the half made up story!

Thats a good analogy. I thought they did a wonderful job with that part of the film. What did you think of the supporting cast? I really liked Elle Fanning and Sharlto Copley in the film as well The supporting cast did wonderful! I've seen Elle Fanning in other movies and boy can she act! Her depiction of Aurora here was just very well done. Sharlto Copley also did a great job as Stefan! It was refreshing to see another version of this character~ Do you agree with the rating of the movie?  Personally, I think it deserved more than 5.7 on Rotten Tomatoes.  I'd give it at least a good 7/10. What about you? Sorry, I forgot to respond right away. I believe it was better than the Rotten Tomatoes and MetaCritic scores... definitely around a 7 or an 8. Do you like superhero movies in general? No worries!  Sorry, I forgot to respond as well.  Yes, I love Superhero movies! How about you?

That sounds good to me, wonder how they proceed. I've never seen the movie myself, so I'm unsure Anything else you want to add about it? Oh, apparently the main character possesses cryokinetic magic, and is locked away in a castle because of that, at some point And maybe they have to escape? Possibly. The plot seems to contradict itself on that point, or it just doesn't tell what happens in between Strange Apparently, the movie is labelled under the genre comedy, adventure, and animation adventure and animation I would've guessed, but didn't know it was a comedy too I do enjoy comedies, yeah it seems more adventerous to me though with the mission? Yeah, that's what I'm thinking Any other cool facts or nah? I mean, not really, I'm just trying to maintain the conversation so we can finish lol I see I see, well I'll probably check it out, my daughter likes disney movies Seems like a good movie, I remember when it was released, people went nuts about it. I'm sure your daughter will enjoy it

Yes it's about girl cliches and fitting in. I think mean girls did actually send a good message a out bullying as well
i am in the midwest i would love to visit one day
It has more of an entertainment value, oh yes for the shock factor I think Yes, I can agree with that. I was definitely shocked while watching lol. What did you think about the ratings? Do you feel they were fair? lol me too. Ratings are always rough, I think they're on par with this one though. I'd give it a B too McGuire & DiCaprio were great in it, and Daisy was casted well I think, how about you? MaGuire* Now that I think about it, I can't really say I could think of anyone else that I would cast other than them. They just played their characters very well, but I dont think this is their best works.
what food do you eat ? othing much . mostly milk and bread i eat organic foods mostly hat is good . its more healthy do you get some autographs ? yea i do . but not that many
Do you think the movie is as good as the book? i reckon so, rotten tomatoes has it rated 97% and imdb with a rating of 8/10 That's a really good rating.  Do you know where it's set? the movie is set on the coast of massachusets on an island called amity would you like to hear some of the critical responses from the movie? Yes, please! some critics have said it is a scare machine that works with computer like precision .............. you feel like a rat being given shock therapy!! Hmmm...not sure how I feel about that.  Any others? others have said a sensationally effective action picture , a scary thriller that works all the better because its populated with characters that have been developed into human beings how do you feel about that? That sounds a little better.  What else can you tell me about the movie that might help me decide whether or not to watch it? well there is alot of a suspense in this movie , as they believe that a killer shark is around , and they decide to hold a shark hunting event so you can imagine the drama and action that comes with such a storyline Do you think it would be a good movie to watch for a date night? of course it would your date would get scared and jump at all the thriller scenes , good excuse to have her cuddle up next to you Are the main characters likeable and interesting? Robert Shaw is absolutely magnificent as a coarse fisherman finally hired to locate the Great White Shark; and Richard Dreyfuss, in another excellent characterization as a likeable young scientist I'm not familiar with Robert Shaw.  What other movies has he been in? from russia with love and the sting this movie is generally a big hit with everyone Are there a lot of special effects in the movie?

It came out in 1995 as Disney’s Pixar for film and first CGI film ever! It’s a landmark for the studio and made CGI the common style of the latest animated features to this day! The story is excellent for adults and children and it brings so many nostalgic memories of childhood that anyone can relate to It has a 100% on rotten tomatoes which is one rating I do agree with And does it have a lot of adventure? Oh definitely! Since they are toys the typical world to us are very dangerous for them. Just going down The stairs for them is a journey And is there a kind of enemy on the movie? Of definitely! A rebel kids that likes to experiment with toys gets a hold of the toys. Some of the toys themselves have their cruel moments. It seems really interesting. And what is your preferred scene? When Buzz Lightyear finds out he’s a toy. Throughout the movie he thinks he an actual space employer and reality kicks in eventually

People will watch anything these days Well aren't you a ray of sunshine? Trying to discuss this movie, which is the point to this conversation. I chose the movie because it was one I liked. Obviously you have no kids I have a kid nice that you would assume otherwise because I dont like the one kid movie you choosed Yes, like I said I am discussing this movie. I didn't realize that Russell Brand was a voice in this movie til I just read it
Okay let's start again What's the basis of the story? Who acts in it?
It's the Wolf of Wall Street. Oh wow, I've heard a lot of good things about that one. What's the actor 's name? It stars Leonardo DiCaprio as Jordan Belfort He's a usually a good one. What kind of role does he play? Should I be ready more for an action role of his or something else? It's more of a black comedy from Belfort's perspective. He was involved in rampant corruption and fraud. I take it that's a commentary on the US's economy or something then? No, not really.  It's about his lifestyle and his craziness. That's a different direction than I expected. Do you know anything about the kinds of reception the movie's gotten? He liked to party a lot according to the critics. 78% Rotten Tomatoes and average 7.8/10 MetaCritic Score 75/100 CinemaScore: C That's mostly consistent, so it sounds like I'll like the movie, but it won't rock my socks off. Who directed it? A guy named Mark Hannah turned him on to the sex and drugs Wall Street lifestyle.

I liked the story as it was pretty heartwarming Pixar always does a fantastic job with funny punch lines The way Gru changes his attitude towards the orphaned kids Yeah that is fun with lots of emotion too smart for kids Did you see the 3D verson It's a good mix of comedy and family drama No, not the 3D Did you see it in 3D?

yes Have you seen it? I don't think I actually ever saw this one haha I saw it once it is so interesting Did you ever look at any of the comic books the movie is based on? yes i think it is a comic based story.. I haven't read any comic but I heard so
I do. I get real into them and try to dig up as much info as I can. Do you know who the villain will be? Obadiah Stone, who is Tony Stark's second in command in Stark Industries. Turncoat who tries to overtake the company! Alright, so a more down to earth super hero movie than some. No super aliens or anything like that? yeah, I like superhero films that rely more on technology and skill than superpowers - feels more within the realm of possibility. Critics describe this as having a military thriller feel, as opposed to a stylized comic book frame by frame replay. no super aliens; grenades, terrorists, and electromagnetic exosuits! and a hint of romance, too; Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts, Tony Stark (Ironman's) potential love interest. This movie has something for everyone! I highly recommend it :) Since it's just called "Iron Man" with no secondary title I'm guessing probably an origin story? Good guess! It's the first film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, actually. Interesting. Since it's the first how is the budget? Do special effects suffer at all? don't know about the budget - but critical response is that it's an "expansively entertaining special effects extravaganza" with relatively seamless CGI

The ratings on the movie are pretty good too! Yes, and there is a lot of tension between characters. it's also been a while for me.  I think when it first came out i seen it and that was probably the last time yes, very true. i dont thinnk i like the sequels too much- but that's usually the way that goes for movies Which of the characters do you love most? i would have to say robert downey in this movie the critical response is a bit confusing on this document- calling the movie depressing the rest of the comments are good about the effects, and the other things.   I dont think i would call the movie depressing tho. Maybe too deep for a superhero movie, don't you think? Like a Ridley scott movie. possibly. it's different then other super heroes movies--- however i think the hulk movie was about the same tho Wow, what about the technical stuff?

I don't know that but you will have to watch for the minions. what are the minions? They help Gru with his plot to shrink and steal the moon what else happens in the movie? Gru adopts three girls but tries to abandon them at theme park but instead he warms up to them. Gru plans to steal the moon when it's nearest the earth but that falls on the same day as the girls' ballet rectial.

yeah i see taht i just think him not being under the cast part is weird I agree Never knew bruce's last name was nolan. I thought it was almighty lol dang multiple romantic interests in this one all i remember is the semi religious parts I'd think under 'critical response' that the church would be offended I love the part when he embarrasses Evan on the news yeah carrel did that perfectly yep Cinemascore: A Cinamascore obviously does not care about the other critics metacritic 46/100 yikes it would be cool if we died and morgan freeman was waiting I don't remember the part where he discovers Jimmy Hoffa
I agree completely! I really thought she'd end up sticking it out and staying with who she was "supposed to" because that was the right thing to do but she didn't. Other than that I found much of it predictable in the sense of movie storylines. I thought Gosling did a great job of promoting displays of emotion from male leads. What do you think? The ending made me incredibly sad.....I've had too much personal experience with dementia and what it can do between family members who were once connected so strongly.  It is devastating to those that are mentally left behind. He really works his way into your heart, doesn't he? Yeah it is. I used to work in the Alzheimer's ward at a nursing home. I've seen it firsthand but never had it in my family. He was so tender and loving. He's definitely a fan favorite for women!

Bet he was a good worker for the fbi. Knowing all the little tricks criminals use Exactly, but when he works there he starts to get the itch to get back into conning, and Carl (who works at the FBI) is constantly worried Carl is gonna disappear again I would too. Don’t blame him for worrying.

hey, what's up, the movie is real steel, have you seen it? I actually have not. How good is it? If you like robot fighting and some boxing action, it is kind of fun to watch.  Then there is the part about a tiny robot rise to challenge the ultimate power house, kind of like rocky for robot It sounds like an interesting movie if you like robots. Well, hugh Jackman play a retired boxer with some trouble in his life who has a kid who discover a really interesting robot, thus the father and son bonding begins so there is the part about family bonding too. That sort of reminds me of an episode of Twilight Zone. When did you see this movie? must have been five years ago, they usually replay it on spike or one of the other movie channel

I wonder If the real guy is still alive. Good chance he is. Movie wasn't set too long ago. To think the guy was only 19 years old when he started. Yeah. Scorcese is a great director. I like it when great ones take on lighter, funnier plots. No reason to be serious all the time. Hey the guy was convincing enough to get a job with American World airways. Probably helps that he was young. You're braver and more confident at that age.
well i was not successful in finding a job so i start a business , so productive lol what kind of business ? wish i was born a prince , i would not have to work . do not we all . i sell random things in local fairs i love fairs ! they have my favorite food , nachos ! hey are yummy , and i am lucky its been better than expected do they have dragons at fairs ? i believe they are real , not fictitious . i am sure they were real at one time , know they exist in only fairytales hat could be true . would be cool if they were pets .

Oh yeah. the Rotten Tomato score is higher than I thought I love anything Jeff Bridges does, too. Still there? yes sorry had to bring cans in its storming. I love jeff bridges as well. Ah, I gotcha. No worries. I thought Gwenyth was a good fit but I'm not a fan of the whole "will they/won't they" interaction. Yes, that is played out. Exactly The tony stark character is believable though. Billionaire playboy etc.. That's how I imagine Elon Musk lol I thought the scene with the reporter was a little much too. Like, do they have to sleep together? Stark is a skeeze. Oh no, I get it. it's believable Lol, nooo, you think Musk is really like that? God I hope not. I can kind of see it though. Musk Industries.

I enjoyed the movie Home Alone.  To me its kind of a cult classic.  What did you think of the movie? I agree with the critics. To me a lot of the story line was based around things happening that were completely implausible for an 8 year old to be able to do on his own. I agree with that as well.  Even though the movie is funny, it does seem very implausible for a family to leave their child behind and not realize it and like you said for an 8 year old to be able to pull off some of those stunts really couldn't happen.  Are you a fan of John Hughes movies? Exactly. How can parents travel all the way to the airport, board their plane, and fly to paris and not once realize they forgot their son?! I cant really say that Im familiar with any John Hughes movies other than Home Alone. I just realized Home Alone came out the year I was born, I cant believe its as old as I am! Well I am a lot older than you.  I had already graduated high school when the movie came out.  I am a fan of John Hughes movies.  I am also a great fan of Joe Pesci and I will say I think he did a great job in this movie. His portrayal of the bumbling thief was great.  He is a great character actor.  Do you have a favorite character in the movie? I agree, Joe Pesci did a great job with his portrayal of that character. Took it from what couldve been something forgettable and boring and turned it into something that is most definitely a classic and will be talked about for ages to come. I also always loved the mom for some reason. I think it was how she was just such an airhead. Always just kind of like "Uhh wait what?" like she didnt know what was going on.

more like an action drama, but it is epic ive seen it like 6 times i think Sounds like it. Do you know who the director is? Christopher Nolan Oh I like his movies a lot. Was a huge fan of the Batman franchise. Batman, I am a huge fan!!! Awesome! I look forward to checking it out If you love his movies, ull love this one I hope you like it I'm sure I will! His movies are always different than other things I've seen. yes, real mind trips
sky are so cahuteeee . jealous hey shed a lot though i am always cleaning up after her
I'm reading about Joseph taking a Mustang to a chop shop. I know I already said it, but this movie sounds too good It is really good!  I liked it a lot.  The scene they are talking about was hilarious.  The mob boss's son gets punched by this guy.  The guy gets called in by the mob boss who is basically going to kill him for hitting his son.  He asks "Why did you do it".  The guy replies "It's John Wick's Car."  The mob boss says "Oh" and lets him go.  He then calls his son in and screams at him.  Haha LOL I'm not even a big movie fan but this has my full attention. I have never head of the director (Chad Stahelski) before but I'll be sure to see what other movies he's made The new plot thread they mention is just relaying the revenge quest he goes on.
i have seen it should i see it again? i do not remember anythign about it then you should know, it's a comedy from 200 with a 100 percent rotten tomaoes score. not too shabby. 1995 what year is it from? oh will it make me cry and laugh? sorry. I picked the wrong day to start drinking Yes. It has emotions are there action sequences? Woody is played by tom hanks you best believe it. The action is undeniable where does it take place? it was directed by john lassiter it takes place in a magical world of your imagination what is the setting though? a world where toys come to life. Kind of like puppet master oh, puppet master. so its a bad movie? is it hand draawn animation or CG? uh, puppet master is awesome, so. no/ But it involves these toys, buzz and woody. One of them is tim allen does it look liek an old movie? it's mindblowing cgi animation. completely 3 dimensions what types of toys are in it? of all the movies from almost twenty yars ago, it is the most modern ,looking child's toys, mostly. Mt potatoehead is in it. Wallace shawn is a dinosaur, so it's pretty good. Ernest was a slinky dog. do all of the toys talk? yeah. Some of the plastic army men communicate by walkie talkie at a birthday party, even\
but health wise a normal human needs a holiday from work i just take personal days from work to have off . you are your own boss , not so ? o i am not my own boss . are you ? lso just employed and can not decide my off oh we get sick days , so i use those when i want a day off
i am not a viking , i am from ca if you are not a viking , what are you ? it is cold in my land . it is warm in my land and we fear vikings greatly . shop at goodwill . i am a friendly viking and i only eat fish that i catch on my viking boat . i would worry that you would sack our recycling centers . o , i just like pillaging and fine dining . i am a polite viking . honestly , i am a liberal ca kid but pillaging sounds fun . oh , i just googled pillaging . that is not good . lol yeah it is a little violent but i will pillage with you if you would like since i am a nice viking friend . i might be profitable . i say we try . reat idea . when should we attempt this ? after we fine dine ? we pillage to get the wine for the fine dine .
yes who was your favorite character? The animation was done very well don't you think? Astrit I think is how they spell it. She is the one Hiccup likes oh yeah! she's awesome They animated it really well! I love the way they make it super realistic and detailed, but still maintain its cartoony feel its a really neat combo yeah I like her attitude and the fact that she dosent wait on a man to save her yes it is. my girls loved it that's awesome! i like that they made a balance with not needing a man to save her like you said,  but still let hiccup and her have a healthy relationship with depth and nuance
i want to retire from baking soon and spend time with my beautiful wife and kids . hat would be nice for you too do that .
That would be interesting. The first movie focused on the startup and social media aspect of it. It's so much more than just a social media now. They could make an entire new movie. Imagine being 19 years old and your girlfriend breaking up with you. Poor little Mark probably thought his life was over at that point. Little did he know it would be the best thing to ever happen to him Seriously! I wonder if it would another movie that David Fincher would want to work on since he directed "the social network" hahaha not many people imagine their life is over after a break up and then go on to become one of the most famous people in the world
do you have any pets ? o mom will not let us have any . distraction what city are you from ?
have you ever watched toy story? Yes I have hmm i'm supposed to convince to watch or not watch the movie *convince you Ok so fill me in on what it's about it's a movie from the mid-90s about a couple of toys they're actually alive and talk with each other, but pretend to be lifeless when humans are nearby Ok so it's obviously a children's movie yep, animated film Ok what are some of the names of the characters and what roles do they play
Yeah, I have a similar attitude towards this movie. Although it is old, it is one of the best comedy movies I have watched. I like the cast in the movie and Macaulay Culkin has done a great job It's always fun to see how he tricks the thieves Yeah, he was just a boy but did a good job in the movie. did you watch the sequel too? Yes, but I like the first one. Do you still remember the scene how Kevin was left behind? yes, he was grounded for misbehaving and has to sleep in the attic the next day his family leaves without realizing Great, you remember the scene perfectly. It is bad that Kevin's parents even did not realize the missing of Kevin until flight's taken off. Yes, I wonder if it could happen in real life Maybe. But Kate, Kelvin's mother experienced so much trouble to get back home. It is common during Christmas. I just realized that the movie received a score of 62% on Rotten Tomatoes. That is low. What do you think about the movie ratings?
Some pretty popular actors what do you think about the cast? yes, i agree meryl streep and tom hanks pretty good.  i dont know the others I love Tom Hanks
It got a 92% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, and it's a superhero movie based on the Marvel Comics. which superheros are in it?
i do not go anywhere all day re you ok ? you sound a little down . yes i hate my life here must be some changes that you can make . what do you enjoy ? i hate everything so i do not know how about pizza . i love pizza , i cannot imagine that anyone would hate that . . . i do hate that too can you make it to your local doctors ? i think you need to talk to them .
It was rated very highly by critics all over the world got good reviews as I see from rotten tomatoes and others Benedict Cumberbatch was a great actor in the lead role would agree and I like to warch Keira knightly too She was great in her role as Joan Clarke I prefer sci fy but got this vid instead\\ I agree, this is more of a historical film like the scenes where Britain declares war on Germany
i am from california and i have 10 chapters more than i see . i live in colorado but i do not own a bike it s easy to learn and you have fun i am hoping to learn to drive one soon
ice . so do you like music ?
I’m not sure of ever seen that is the McAuley caulkin is one Yes he is the main character. It looks like it  didn’t have the greatest reviews it looks like rotten tomato has it 62% I think that’s a bad score yeah it's not very high It has a strange premise Oh I see Joe Pesci was in this movie too He is is pretty funny What’s the promise
i would love to get a masters degree but i am too old what did you do when you were younger ? i learned to swim and still do . i was a harvester on my fathers farm what kind of music do you like ? i love the blues . what about you ? i love kid rock or as i like to call him senator rock . what do you like to do ? still love to swim everyday since i was a little girl . and you ? rdening is my lifelong passion
d d is from dr who oh wow , what would be a good name for a dog from russia ? shar for maria sharipova she pretty too you can give me some ideas ?
It's based on a memoir by Jordan Belfort. The movie recounts Belfort's career as a stockbroker and all the corrupt practices of his firm. That is interesting, I recently heard his name was in the news, but I cannot remember what the headline was.  I think he was arrested or something.  I'll have to check that out.  Who plays Belfort? Leonardo DiCaprio. I swear he can't do no wrong, might be interesting to watch just to see him. I like Leo, although my God he is looking old and haggard these days.  what are you doing Leo??!!  jeez.  Who else is in this thing? It also features Margot Robbie as his wife Naomi Lapaglia. Wow, she is fantastic, did you happen to see I Tonya? No. It's on my watch list. OH, man, it is riveting!  You will love it, especially if you were an 80's kid like me and grew up watching the spectacle. I'm a nineties kid, but still the story seems interesting. And back to this movie it was released in 2013, when Leonardo DiCaprio was younger. It really doesn't have that many good reviews. Rotten Tomatoes gave it a 7.8, Metacritic a 75 and Cinemascore gave it a C. Well, you know, it's not really a natural fit for me.  The whole Wall Street thing.  I find it so disturbing, I guess.  Just a bunch of rich jerks.  Although I guess that any story, if well told, can be interesting. Oh, those scores are not that impressive, no, are they? I often do rely on ratings and reviews to decide what movie to see. Not really. I don't really decide what to watch solely on those scores, but they help. One of my favorite sites to read movie reviews is....ah....it's right here...I forgot. I mean I may watch a movie with bad ratings if I find the story interesting. Do you like Scorsese films. I forgot to tell you that this is a Scorsese film. rogerebert.com is the site I like to read.  He's been gone for years now but there are plenty of his old reviews and some fine writers to cover the new movies.
I thought it was an interesting concept, pretty entertaining.

This film was released 1995 Oh that's right. Are you a fan of Toy Story? Not yet but will enjoy the preview Well 100% on Rotten Tomatoes, not a bad score... Children loved this type of film, espeicially the audio Buzz Lightyear has always been a big hit. Tim Allen does a grave job doing the voice. Wasnt there some other films they did there voiec work on as well? Pretty sure there is. Tim Allen and Tom Hanks are well known actors. 1995 was decades ago, but this movie never gets old Those two also star in an sequel I am not sure if they starred in Toy Story 3
Especially after all they went through to get to safety. Yes they thought they were going to be criticized but they were praised.

Of course. The voice was perfect for the character. He is pretty charming, especially at that time in his life. Toys coming to life is like a basic fantasy for every kid too. Should I watch the movie today? Absolutely I think it still holds up. It has a sort of classic buddy comedy feel with the ticking clock of Andy's family moving to drive the drama. It seems like a sad movie to watch today Woody, Reex, Sarge and everyone integrating with Buzz Lightyear is a great dynamic as well I think it still has a hopeful tone to it What sort of hopeful tone? Well after Buzz and woody end up fighting and falling out of the window and end up going to pizza planet and getting stuck in the crane game. You kind of think that its all down hill for the characters but even tho they are picked up by andy's evil neighbor Sid They manage to start working together When they start working together, do they get back home away from Sid? Or does Sid capture them forever? he captures them and uses them for his experiments or at least he plans to but then wood and buzz start to work together How do they get away? Well just as buzz is strapped to a rocket and about to be destroyed woody organizes the other toys and recuses him That is so nice! Then as they are trying to catch the moving truck woody and buzz get jumped by scud and woody has to leave buzz behind Oh no! but when he gets to the moving truck he and RC go back to rescue buzz however RC starts to run out of batteries That is bad luck

I think that is the big unknown. again well played by nolan, or the writer.. Probably Nolan. He likes doing some sort of surprise in his movies
I mostly thought the casting was good. Leonald DiCaprio was great as Jordan Yeah, it had a great cast, I love how Leonardo DiCaprio acts Surprised it only gotten 78% from Rotten Tomatoes. his role was pretty good in The Wolf of Wall Street. Yeah I know! It has low ratings, shoud have higher ones I didn't know DiCaprio was also a producer... I didnt know that either, did you like the role of Jonah Hill? He played Donnie, right? I like him anyway. I think he was good. Yeah, he was Donnie, and I also liked him a lot so what do you think about the critic responses So the scene was based on 1987. I guess somethings change but somethings stay the same... I think the critics are too harsh... Yeah I agree I think that the critic responses are wrong as well as the ratings definetely a great movie It's just a black comedy...just a movie. Lighten up! lol Yeah lol I know! So what was your favorite scene from the movie? Jordan and Donnie are kind of unlikely partners/friends and I found the dynamic interesting. I don't know...what is your favorite scene? I like it when Jordan makes 22 million in an illegal way. I thought it was really fun and exiting. Yeah, it's crazy! Yeah it is! I also liked when the FBI arrests Jordan and when he receives a reduce sentence. There were some surprising twists to the plot... Donnie ratting out on Jordan.
what else do you enjoy ?
i also like chili corn dogs and also pizza i like to be alone sometimes just to gather my thoughts , do you ?
Yeh, I liked the Little Mermaid, but yeah this was better. Elsa throwing away her crown was just such a moment for me. It was so freeing!
hat is nice at least you weren not alone
here is enter sandman , one more light , man in the box .
the title is "zootopia" I feel like it is a play on "utopia" but with animals clever! that makes sense.  Real animals or animated? Animated :) It is a very cute movie! i haven't seen it. :) What's it about? It is about an optimistic rabbit from a small town who travels to "zootopia" to become a police officer (apparently something only larger animals usually become) She soon becomes the first bunny cop! Awww.  That does sound cute!  And some good messages too! Then she meets a fox who is a con artist but she ends up becoming friends with him as he helps her solve a case. It also has valuable messages such as how wrong it is to discriminate against others. :D Rotten Tomatoes rated it at 98% that's cool.  I like when there are morals to the story. I agree with their rating. Me too!

Yeah, they did justice to most of the characters despite a pretty large cast. I liked Don Rickles as comedy relief as Mr. Potato Head a lot more than the comic relief from Rex, but Rex was still pretty adorable for his part. Gotta have some broad appeal to different audiences, right?

Yes, and I love it.  The Blind Side is a great movie. Have you seen it? I haven’t seen it. What did you like about it? Sandra Bullock plays Leigh Ann Tuohy and her husband played by Tim McGraw sort of take in a very large black man into their very white home How was Tim McGraw’s role in it? He was a good supporting actor in it Is it just about sports? Have any drama in it? It's about football, (not my favorite subject), but I was engrossed in it because Michael Oher, goes from living with a drug addicted mom who doesn't even really know where she is, much less herself and Michael learns how to trust and make his own decisions, as opposed to everyone thinking they know what's best for him or ignore him completely, like with his mom Do you agree with the rotten tomatoes and meta scores?
i get you . i consider myself very beautiful
hat sounds pretty interesting . do you like animals h , my deadbeat dad never let me get one , we hardly speak now what happened with that situation
yeah , that is cool . pets are a big commitment
Yes, that's why I hope Jay Gatsby made Daisy Buchanan who's in a relationship with Joel Edgerton show up in Jay's wild parties. The Roaring Twenties seemed like a wild time. What I like about the Great Gatsby is that it lived up to its genre, it's so romantic! It really is, Nick Carraway narration  and I'm so glad his doctor had him write his stories of Jay Gatsby down so we have  the movie.

It sounds better than I would have thought. yes he played the founder of nabster, and an invenstor in facbook

Yes, but she is the one that turned Moors into a dark kingdom in the first place. Does correcting that at the end make her a hero or? Do you think maleficent slowly started to regret what she did, or right after seeing that the pixies were failing to take care of aurora? I believe she did that to protect herself and her heart. Once she learned how to care and love changing the the Dark Kingdom into one of light was a natural progression. I think she started to regret her actions when she saw the love in Aurora's heart. Do you think Aurora took the right action when she found out about maleficents true identity? Meaning running to her fathers castle What character pulled you into the story more maleficent or Aurora? What do you think others say about the same question? I think she was scared and did what she could to protect herself. Maleficent pulled me into the story. I think others would say Aurora.
i like combat boots with dresses too .

2005, yes.   It relaunched the Batman movies after the mess that was Batman and Robin in '97. I agree, he's the main reason this worked so well. Looking at the reviews, rotten tomatoes gives it 84% 7.7/10 Do you like other types of movies too? I think that's low!  The second one got more interest because of Heath Ledger's death, but this one set the bar really high. Yes, although I'm big on Sci-Fi, I like comedies even more. What do you like to watch?
whats up Not much. I have Despicable Me here, have yo useen that movie? i haven't that's an animation right Yea, with Steve Carrell Pretty funny, my kids love it.

I know! Cool Runnings was my fave of his! Kevin returns home and rigs the house with numerous booby traps. love those scenes Is that the one with Bobsled team? yes. Yes, I loved that movie. It has been forever since I last watched it. The McCalister family is preparing to spend Christmas in Paris, gathering at Peter and Kat'es home outside of Chicago on the night before their departure. Peter and Kate's youngest son, eight ear old Kevin, is bein ridicule by his siblings nad cousins. Harry and Marv break in, spring traps, and suffer various injuries. How could I forget them, they are the main reason I loved the movie so much. On Christmas Day, Kevin is  disappointed to find that his family is still gone. How can anyone leave their kid!? Yes, I love them too. I know. We did it, great survey. Take care. You too!

Oh yeah, the way they do makeup now-a-days is incredible Keeping the creature in her bathtub sounds like a very inventive idea, what did you think of it? It reminds me of Splash. I think they put Daryl Hannah in the tub at some point. Flooding the whole bathroom sounds challenging. Oh yeah. Have you seen Stranger Things? *The It Movie Yes, I enjoy that show They have a challenging scene in that movie as well With bloody walls I wouldn't want to clean that up Neither would I. This movie turned quite violent towards the end. I'm not sure I would enjoy that. At least the relationship is positive, even in the end. What an interesting "happily ever after." She gets gills. Hunh. Kind of like SHrek with the princess becoming an ogre That's a hilarious comparison. Good job. It seems fitting. I like a fantasy tale with a twist. Don't we all. Grimm fairytales are great too. It was nice chatting with you.
i didn't know this but helen miren is also a voice in the movie. it's crazy how many well known "actors" use their voices for these things Toy Story was a classic i even think they did a new one of that it's so hard to keep up with because there's another a new fad or movie that the kids go crazy about every year or so i remember how insane the frozen fad was my nieces went crazy I just saw references to it everywhere, never saw it. teased nephew that he was getting frozen dolls for xmas Will keep an eye out for Monsters, Inc.  sounds like it could be funny, there's always some adult humor hidden in those kids movies. there really is monsters inc has a lot of good humor too for adults i'm surprised it didn't end up bigger than it really was Will look for it.

I think I've seen a couple scenes from it but never all the way through so this'll be a surprise for me. Ok, so the movie is about Frank Abagnale. He was a guy that performed successfully cons worthy of millions of dollars. Who is he played by? And he was so successful that after a while the FBI turned to him for help with catching other forgers. DiCaprio is starring and Wom Hanks sorry, Tom Hanks :) And also Christofer Walken, MArtin Sheen and Nathalie Baye Awesome, I didn't realise there were any Hanks movies I haven't seen Oh!

Hi there! Have you seen the movie Catch Me If You Can? No i havent. what is it about It's a true story about a guy, Frank Abagnale, who performs cons worth millions of dollars by posing as other people. Leo DiCaprio is plays Frank and does a very good job. Tom Hanks and Christopher Walken are also in it. wow, that sounds pretty interesting. so its a cops and robbers kind of movie almost then?
oh , is that so ? i both like red and blue either yes , it is so . i am an investment banker , i know how much i should really pay . hat is cool . do you own pets i do not . they are filthy animals . i got 2 different dogs , even dogs ? ven dogs . they are commoners . where did you go to school ? bulldog and pitbull , and i love them where did you go to school ? i went to princeton . i went just nearby the house oh . okay . that is not a very good education then .
One critic liked the "B-movie fun" of the film, another liked that Reeves returned to the action/thriller genre, and another really liked the movment of the film. It has an 86% on Rotten Tomatoes, which is a pretty great score overall That is a pretty good score! Does "B-movie fun" mean that the film is shallow but has a lot of engaging action? I think the critic means that the film's plot isn't overly complicated, since it's a pretty easy to follow revenge story, but it has a lot of action and interesting fight scenes, which I also agree with. So the revenge plot is initiated when someone kills Reeves' dog? Partly. His character is retired and his vintage car is stolen and his puppy is killed. The puppy was a gift from his wife who had recently died, which is why he's so upset about this and is seeking vengeance. I find the use of the puppy very interesting, as it definitely gets the audience on his side and makes you root for him, even though he's a hitman and generally isn't a character that should be "rooted for."
maybe you can watch a funny movie ? my favorite is pretty woman ! i have cried to put away the hunger but it has refused

wolf of wallstreet Have you seen it before? I love that movie yes a while back Leo deserved an oscar for that performance the quaaludes (sp?) scene was amazing he does, I cant remember that scene please remind me it should be on the document somewhere honestly but it's the scene where he is ridiculously high on drugs namely quaaludes oo ok lol and he crawls out to his car and thinks he makes it home fine when in reality he crashed and basically totaled his car yea I remember that that and margot robbie was fantastic just a great great movie lol yes indeed people making small fortunes high risk what else does it say on the document?
I have seen a few movies with Chris Evans I like that they all had separate movies and then combined them all into one movie. Same.

I guess maybe they didn't think a clean-cut kid would do something like that. The new document we just got jogged my memory about the French class scene and I think its just another example of a clean-cut kid being able to get away with murder by just acting the part He was very resourceful. Most children who run out of money would end up heading back home after running away That's true, he must've really been shattered by his home life. Its a little sad actually. I think DiCaprio did a good job of conveying that betrayal you really saw it in his face at different scenes.

Do they build their own robots? He is a great act to me. His character Charlie seems to have a lot of problems I think they do or they have people wearing a black suit with many white balls to act like the robot. That sounds cool This movie was basic on a book call steel that came out in 1956 I did like the part when he found the robot and train it to be a boxers. Ooh Anthony Mackie! I live him! He cool. So in the end, the humans have to box for the robots? What a twist! Yes what a twist. I do like that fact that he realize that he can do that boxing motion and the robot will copy.

Home Alone HOW DID YOU LIKE IT? I KNOW THEY MADE A FEW OF THESE MOVIES. DID YO SEE THE FIRST ONE? Some of the traps were implausible and it was hard to care about Kevin I watched the one made in 1990. SO IS IT A GOOD FAMILY MOVIE? THAT MUST HAVE BEEN THE FIRST ONE. It is a comedy that features an 8 year old and it was full of adult-bashing so it would be a family movie. IN YOUR OPINION IS IT WORTH SEEING? If you like slapstick humor, then yes, but otherwise most of it is unsurprising and flat. IT SOUNDS LIKE IT IS A REAL PREDICTABLE MOVIE. Kevin, the main character, is accidentally left behind when his family leaves for Christmas in Paris. ARE THERE A LOT OF BIG NAME ACTORS IN IT? He initially liked being alone but then he had to deal with burglars. Yes, Macaulay Culkin, Joe Pesci, Daniel Stern, John Heard, and Roberts Blossom make up the main cast. IS IT A LONG MOVIE? I am not sure how long the movie lasted actually. IS THERE ANY SUSPENSE AND DRAMA OR IS IT ALL COMEDY There is some suspense as Kate, the mom, discovers Kevin is missing and has to try and make it back to the United States. WOULD YOU SEE ONE OF THE SEQUELS? I was not aware there was a sequel. I THINK THERE WAS ONLY ONE AND I THINK IT BOMBED WAS THE MOVIE REALISTIC OR FANTASY? Well, it did only score a 5.5/10 on Rotten Tomatoes and a metacritic Score of 63/100. That said, it earned an A on CinemaScore surprisingly. SO I GUESS IT WAS BASED ON DIFFERENT PEOPLES TASTES It was realistic. It is based on on booby traps that Kevin set in his house that are sprung by Harry and Marv, the burglers. For example, one burgler was knocked unconcious by a now shovel. DID IT KEEP YOUR ATTENTION OR DID YOU GET BORED? It sounds like it varies based on people's tastes. It did to a certain extent. It was full of action and then a reconciliation with his Mom when she does return for him.

that's unusual many times - good to hear.  Do you know if the same voice actors portray Mike and Sully? As in Monsters Inc. It matches the tone of the movie. The same actors do portray Mike and Sully. Why do they not like each other at first? They do have different voice actors to portray the younger versions, like grade school versions. oh - i understand. Mike is jealous of Sully because he has a natural ability to scare, whereas Mike has to study.
Oh it's an animation. Do you think I should watch it? I definitely think you should watch it! It is very thought-provoking and has a good story line. It is about a rabbit who becomes a police officer. The chief doesn't believe she can do it even though she was valedictorian of her class, and she is put on parking duty. hahahha nice. It's just that when I think of animation I think of cartoons. What kind of ratings do you think it got It had a 98% on Rotten Tomatoes. I am not surprised. The movie also has some action scenes where the rabbit (Judy) blackmails a fox (Nick) into helping her to track down Otterton. This sets off an exciting chain of events where they eventually arrest the mayor of the city. 98% that is very very high. Hahah interesting story scenes for a animated movie. Do you think this movie is for kids or adults? I really liked it because of the message behind it, but it is a great movie for kids as well. It is fast-paced and funny.

This was one of the best kids animated movies ever Agreed! I think the AAA actors for voice acting was a smart decision that helped put the movie as highly ranked as it was. I love how it's as much for adults as it is for kids too. Very cool. I had no idea it got 100% on Rotten Tomatoes, though. I can't think of another movie that has been ranked so high! Totally well deserved. Do you agree with the ratings of this movie? Are you still there? yes i do agree with it. i dont like rotten tomatos but i agree that it should be 100%

It does mention that Vector, the competing villain, stole one of the great Pyramids. Are the villains competing against each other? Here's a little more detail now, not much about the Minions other than the fact that Gru, with no loan, cannot afford to pay his Minion workers. Both Vector and Gru are after the same thing - the shrink ray, and then the moon. The catch is Vector is related to the director of the Villains Bank... Do you know what ages this movies is recommended for?

Hello. Hi, have you seen the John Wick movies? I have seen the first one but I have not seen the second one.
Is the movie action packed? Do you know any of the supporting characters' names? Quite so. It's set during World War I and is describes as not demurring from depicting from war time violence Whats its rating as far as kids go? Is it PG-13? I'm not sure. You should check that out online for sure. It seems like a pretty good movie for a tomboy. Did you know the movie is directed by a woman? Patty Jenkin's the first woman to direct a live action theatrical movie. How did it do at the box office? I'm not sure. But based on the high scores, I'm sure it did well. And my fave guy, Chris Pine co-stars. He plays a pilot, how dreamy.

Hello, Have you seen a movie called John Wick
Yes definitely. They  did a good job creating a "magical" world. It isn't my favorite, but I like it okay. What about you? Same. Do you think that impacts your feelings about Maleficent? I think it was interesting how they gave the villain in Sleeping Beauty more depth and made her more complex in this movie I didn't have strong feelings about her character to begin with though. Do you think you might feel differently about Sleeping Beauty now that you've seen this movie?
i am great ! i am at home here in l . a . where are you from ? i am in hawaii . it is gorgeous hat would be beautiful . i love the outdoors . hawaii has so much nature . he food is amazing . i moved out when i was young . i want to get there eventually . he water is my home . i feel like a mermaid . i do live near the beach . but no water in my home . i love drawing and watching cartoons

I dig computer animation. Do you know how the movie ends? It has been several years since I've seen it, but I'm pretty sure they make friends with the dragons. Did they give you a synopsis of the movie? You should have a Document right there They didn't give me anything. Do you remember who the voice actors are in the movie? sure I'm looking at the preview right now Chris Sanders Dean DeBlois I am not familiar with either one of those guys, but it seems like Gerard Butler plays his dad is that correct? The look like vikings voice cast is Jay Gerard Oh yeah, I forgot they were Vikings, and the main guy is sort of a Wimpy viking. HAHA yeah The dragon looks a dit different than a normal dragon I am going to have to go check it out again. Yeah same here Its's funny from what i see in the previews It seems like he befriends a rare dragon. Is that correct? yeah he finds it Does it say what kind of dragon it is? I really like dream work animations yes, they do pretty good. No it does not say Well hey I think we are done =) Have we sent enough messages? oh maybe not xD My finish conversation button is not activated yet.

Just didn't have the chance to see it. The film is based on boxing but with robots. What do you think of boxing?| I have no interest in boxing and even less interest in boxing robots lol! how about you? Boxing is a great sport, but it's very boring for the most part. Where do people come up with things like "World Robot Boxing" which is the premise of the movie. I like real life movies. It's computer-generated I guess since its suppose to take place in 2020 robots can box. HOWEVER, that not really so futuristic anymore, we're almost there! yeah, that doesn't make sense, but the story was written a long time ago I guess, and they never changed it The movie is about gambling as well. It supposedly has really good computer and human interaction scenes the technology is getting better, so they probably did that well. If it were possible to watch a match between two real robots today and it was free, would you watch it? yes, and they already have them, but nothing like this. Seriously? Are they toys or real robots real robots but not controlled by people inside them. Interesting. Well it was nice talking with you have a great day you too.
i only like the skin off the apple . he skin is good for you . i sometimes feed pieces to my parakeet . y kind of fruit is good for parakeets oh i did not know that ! thanks !
I definitely think having a woman director adds to the film. Yes. I agree. Did you like Chris Pine in the movie? I did like chris pine in it. Did you? Yes. I think his character as the love interest was valuable. I  alsothought robin wright was great as Antiope. Chris pine's character's name was trevor , right? Chris Pine's character was named Steve Trevor, yes. Ah.thanks I think it woudl be fun to go to the hidden island of Themyscira, if only it were real. Yes, before it was invaded by the German ship. It was sad to see Antiope die to save Diana. Ya, with all the training they have the battle might have been a rush to be in though... Sacrifices like that are hard but heartfelt. But zeus did create them to protect human kind and she knew diana was the one to do it. The godkiller is a pretty powerful item. I agree that the training would be a rush. I thought the scenes of Antiope training Diana were very touching. I liked those too. I think the Amazonians are great. I thought it was great that Diana resisted Ares' temptations. Were you surprised by the reveal of sir patrick  to be Ares? I was quite surprised by that revelation. I liked that she turned ares own lightning against him. Although he claimed to only instill subtle ideas in humans, I think he did much more than that. Interesting. I like that it went back and forth from present to past as well. Well I certainly see how it got the high rating on rotten tomatoes... 92% Definitely, me too. I think the acting and the directing were fantastic. Yes they employed some good techniques. Yay for patty jenkins! I think they definitely left it open for future movies to be made. Especially incorporating Bruce Wayne.

It was not meant to be real But it was entertaining to watch? Very entertaining. Loved it Did the characters play their part well, or did it seem like a canny performance? I take it there was a lot of action. Would it be appropriate for children? Yes. I took my kids Great The action was good. How long was it? Was there a lot of blood and guts type action? no. it was fake how would you describe the action?  Was it like fighting? It was only fighting People got knocked out and that was it Hmmm.... maybe not what I would want for younger girls? yes Was it animated? no I took my 5 year old Were there any animals in it no No animals.

ok, i was wondering how the rating system worked? so they had a very good rating. at 90% also ever heard of a flick called the imitation game that was made in 2014 yup i think so? do it have michael douglas, in it? it was a type of drama that was based on a biography by allen turner so it's suppose to be a true story? I dont think so but i do think one of the guys looks liek him ha ha! i think you told a joke!? well with hollywood i'm sure they added some things to make it a little more crazy and fun to watch yep, i'm sure they did. Lol :) lol what's your favorite movie? well my favorite movie is t2 what is that movie about? never heard of it? is that short for something? toh sorry i mean termanitor 2 i'll be back lol oh, okay. lol what about you what movie is you fav? what's the most interesting part in the movie? the part where the metal skeleton of the robot is burn looking like death clad in metal I like all kinds of movies... I recently watched the Greatest Showman, and I really enjoyed it oh really what was it about oh, i see it's about the uprise of the Wringling Brothers & Barnum Bailey Circus oh so a type of doc. like movie? It has a lot of cool acrobatic stunts, and it moves at a good pace. cool i think i saw a preview for it no it was a fictional movie, based on this topic oh ok loosely based on this topic got to love the work loosely it lets you get away with so much stuff.

The director is good who? patty jenkins never heard of her yeah it's a good film do you like comics? not really but movies based on comics, yes
It's a neo-noire action thriller about a guy out for revenge Why does he want revenge? Some people steal his car and kill his puppy, which was a gift from his recently deceased wife.  It's a neat twist that really makes the film stand out over other action flicks That sounds like an interesting movie. What are some of the actors that play in it?
I thought it was interesting how little the Scarecrow played a role in this film It was a comfotable mix it was.  14 years later Chill is freed in exchange for testifying against Gotham city male boss Carmine Falcone. Burce intends to murder him but one of Falcones assassins does so first. Liam Neeson definitely held his own on screen as both a mentor to Bruce and a zealot who went deep into his beliefs He did and did you know that as a child bruce wayne falls down into a dry well and is attacked by a swarm of bats so he has a phobia of bats now After watching this film, I felt strongly that Bale as Batman was an excellent choice Christman Bale played an excellent Batman in the story he learns the league intends to destroy gotham beleieving it to be corrupt

Although their epic journey leads them to encounters I also really enjoyed the reindeer name Sven

Of course not. The plot has contrivances to set up Kevin being left home, alone The movie was ready to take a really dark turn when Harry and Marv finally captured Kevin. It's a nice relief when Marley hits them with his shovel
o milk for me , though . hurts my stomach . before you died you should take a walk on the beach . that is something i really enjoy .

The one with Macauley Culkin fending off his house from invaders? Of course Wait no Not the first It's so cute. I haven't seen it since it first came out. Yes, the one with Macauley And Joe Pesci was one of the would be robbers. What makes the first worth seeing if I thought the second was just alright The ways that Macaulay pulled tricks on the robbers was hilarious. He set up traps that were kind of like Rube Goldberg machines. Catherine O'Hara and John Heard play his parents. I think they are good too.
so do you have any hobbies like mine is skateboarding . i am not a tomboy though . yes my hobbies are writing poetry , fishing , bike riding , etc . ice ! you must be really smart and educated too . yes i am very smart and educated must be plus for employment . i work at a pizza shop glad because i love pizza what are your favorite tv shows ? i like the 70s show . i know its old .
Oh, well it is pretty similar to that one Yes, it is really cute The colors are really vibrant and held my 4 year olds attention This one is about the characters at college. yes, i was just thinking my kids would enjoy this movie and i love comedies john goodman is a good actor It is funny! OMG, yes he is!!! not to bad of a rating either When the movie first starts out Mike and Sulley don't really like each other and are always trying to one up one another But by the end they overcame their differences and became the best of friends. ah ok, well im gonna have to watch that It has a great lesson for kids in it awesome do you watch a lot of movies Not really my kids control what we watch. So it is a lot of films like this oh ok This movie has a few scary parts, but my kids still liked it Do you watch a lot of movies? couple times a month we all sit down and watch a movie but its usually something scary or really funny That's cool! my kids do watch a lot of anime movies, they have probably seen this movie l like that this shows how the got their jobs . In the first one they are in the mail room, but it never really told you how they met each other. sounds like it would be a really good movie interesting it is, you should check it out yes i will

I found it despicable that her mother hid all those letters from her, things would have been so different. Yeah totally gave him the wrong impression. Still he goes and buys that house they were in anyways Yes he does, he looked past what her parents thought of him in the end. Even after seeing her kiss someone else I'm glad she didn't stay with the man she was to marry, I think she would have been unhappy all her life, like her mother Most definitely. She reunites with Noah, and sparks start flying It's like falling in love all over again
I would give it a 70% rating. How did you find the ending ?
HOw did she get the creature? Doesn't anyone know the creature is missing? Yes, Strickland discovers he is missing That is someone from the facility? Colonel Richard Strickland discovers him in her apartment The alien was eating a cat

Is it a regular shark or a super shark? It is a giant man-eating great white shark so I guess you could call that a super shark. Does the shark kill a lot of people in this film? I do not know how many people are killed in the film, but it is described as too gruesome for children so I am sure there were many people killed. Interesting, I think I'll watch this film

It does sound promising, do you know what studio made it? Pixar studios made the film. Do you typically watch animated films? Actually I misread that. I'm not sure who made the film but it is compared to the level of Pixar in the reviews. Oh OK. I do like the Pixar stuff a lot

Me too. It has a good review also. I think it is a good movie It really does. The review from Rotten Tomatoes of 86% was really good. Do you know when it came out? its 2009 not sure of the month though Oh, okay. Wow, that was a while ago. I like Christopher Nolan's work, too. Yep. I am not familiar with his work but I think this movie is good. I was surprised that it was categorized by a scientific genre But I guess it makes sense...kind of.

viggo must have been surprised when john was able to complete the impossible task I love the part where John is at the hotel and Ms Perkins tries to kill him. yeah, that was good action. but i don't like watching men beat up women. i'm glad it wasn't too graphic. i don't know why john had to destroy viggo's money though. you'd think he could do something better with it.

llo ! how are you ? i am great ! how are you ?
Hello how are you? Good Morning Im Doing well Have you seen Toy Story before? The movie we will be discussing today is Toy Story. Yes I have seen it plenty of times the movie is great The original is probably my favorite although I enjoyed both of the sequels I have seen it many time as well-my kids love it! I read that they are in production of Toy Story 4. I cant wait I agree with you, I love number 1 the best, I felt that the 3 rd one was just ok The idea is brilliant. A story revolved around the daily life of toys and action figures when no one is looking I know, love woody and the Trex! Little bo peep lady is pretty funny too-very flirty! I loved the rescue operation at the toy store! And Mr and Mrs potato heads!:-) Yes Trex was a great addition my favorite was probably Buzz or the army men. Me and my little brother would always crack up at the end of the movie when Woody reveals to Sid that the toys are real. So Play Nice !!! Yes the potato heads were great Tom Hanks was on a roll. Toy Story came out the following year after forrest Gump. I dont know where he even found time to do the role He loses his parts and Mrs Potato head helps him put them back in:-) Tom Hanks was very good so was Tim Allen very expressive Such a great animation for both, kids and adults!
Not real high. It's a funny, rather corney movie. Jim Carrey overacts but there are some good laughs. Although I do LOVE Morgan Freeman in most anything he does. You said it got 81 on rotten tomatoes,  mine says 48
I think it helped them to get on the same side. I think it was great that Batman saved Superman and Martha Yes it was very helpful. Superman's death was also very sad.  Do you agree with Luthor that his death has mad the world vulnerable to powerful alien threats? Yes if Superman dies than some alien presence that is equal to him would be more difficult to stop. Due to the complex emotional nature of the film's plot, what do you think about the 27% Rotten Tomato's score?
c amon down . i will introduce you to my sister and her dog ciales . ll . does your dog like pizza too ? i love dogs but do not have one . san francisco has the best healthy pizza though .

Yes, but historical movies, not so much for modern subject, especially social network. It received high remarks though, maybe I can get myself to watch it sometime. Gotcha. Well, maybe this one will be the one that opens your eyes to the genre! Some even labeled it as "Move of the Year" when it came out in 2010 The drama aspect adds a good deal of artistic license to it that should make it more enjoyable than a typical modern biographical That was a while ago, I thought it was newer, but movies stand the age of time. Yup. Yes, 2010 was quite some time ago. I'm a bit of a techie, so I like to know about the history of popular modern technology, which is why I enjoyed this film. Especially the early portrayal of Mark Zuckerberg Well that is good. I will have to try and watch it one night. I am not familiar with the director. I didn't know that Justin Timberlake was in this movie either. I'm a fan of Aaron Sorkin's film writing, so I enjoyed the screenplay aspect of this film. Yes, Justin Timberlake plays Sean Parker. I only know of Mark Zuckerberg and his Facebook career from college a little, that is about it. Gotcha. Well you see, Sean Parker was the founder of Napster and helped Zuckerberg and associates from college to spread the network to become the billion dollar brand it ended up becoming. Ah, I did not know that. I know Facebook is huge, even years after it was first made.
i am only 4 11 and a half . i also do gymnastics , i love it

A review ranked it as one of their top 10 films
I certainly would. And it seems that critics agree given it's impressive ratings. Did anyone win awards for their roles? I'm not sure What do you think about toys coming alive?
i do not work currently . i saw ghosts at my old job and quit . wow ! ! ! that had to be scary yes . i have seen them a lot of places . it may be your calling to be a ghost hunter hat would be an interesting job ! ! ! i think i would like it lol it might be a little too scary though !
i do and i do not look as old as i am .
ca not do much from the bed , but computer games are great way to pass the time
That's understandable! It seems IMDB gives the movie an 8/10, which I'd say is still pretty good! 8 on imdb ratings is pretty much as high as they get. i don't think i've ever seen anything above an 8. can't think of any movies with higher than 8. maybe god father or shawshenk That sounds about right. The genre of this movie falls under Comedy, Adventure, and Animation. So if you're a fan of those types of films, then this film will definitely be a good match up ok guess i'll check it out
i , how are you today ? hi ! i am great ! just finished making a huge birthday cake ! oh cool ! my birthday is soon . i want to go to europe . hat would be fun ! i just started a new career . yes ! i would love to go on a cruise ship too . what is your career ? i am a baker . a cruise sounds like it would be fun ! i am excited to go dancing this weekend with my boyfriend . do you dance ? i do . i like to dance to country music ! you ? yes ! i need to find new dancing shoes but i wear a size 12 ! oh no ! i use the internet a lot . you could look up shoes there . ood idea ! weekend are my shopping days but i will search the internet weekends are good for shopping . i find the internet more convenient . it is nice sometimes to avoid the crowds and i can shop in my pajamas lol . yes ! i love that part ! and no make up !
Hey, have you seen the avengers? I do not have the paragraph And yes I have! ah ok the paragraph is on the avengers I think you should give it another watch so you can appreciate it even more. ok great I was going to ask about it yeah I would want to anywyas before the new movie come sout I do not remember everything from the previous ones yeah that's a good idea for a refresher what questions do you have about it? what aspects of the movie do you personally think were its strengths and likewise for its wekanesses? I thought the plot was a strength. It was about how Loki makes it to earth and tries to take the Tesseract I thought it made the movie exciting I also thought the cast was a strength lots of big names like robert downey jr. and scarlett johansson I personally thought the same about the plot and definitely agree about the cast I believe marvel cast the perfect people for their roles Yeah it's basically how I imagined they would be surprisingly one of the rating websites only ranked it 69/100 along the lines of plot do you think one would need to watch the first avengers to see the second or third? yeah i believe critics do not really appreciate marvel movies I dont know if it's necessary per se, but I do think it would be a big help they are more of the peoples movies One of the biggest appeals of the avengers is that its a lot of action and superheroes and you can generally pick up on the plot quickly the only thing you might not get is some inside jokes from the previous movies Do you think that is why they appeal to large audiences and garner the biggest box offices? and perhaps you might not understand about S.H.I.E.L.D that much Yeah I think the quality of the movie is really good and the general public likes superheroes also the cast is good looking I definitely do not know much about s.h.i.e.l.d and yes superheros are very public friendly another thing is that the setting is mostly in new york city, which is nice because it makes it more relatable as opposed to a made up city like you can see hulk and loki fighting on the streets it's pretty cool
I've seen a lot of his movies too. I guess I didn't see this one due to it being sci-fi Yeah its really Interesting thast sees a projection of his father.
piercings are cool . i do not have any though . i had to drive a long time to get them too . so what do you do for fun ? hang out with my many friends and go hunting and stuff . what kinds of hunting do you do ?

Hi seen any good movies I went and saw a movie called "the imitation game" it is based on true events, but I dont think so
I think my fingers would fall off from saying all my favorites. I think in scene 1 they listed in the document, if they didnt suppress Elsa's powers, she easily could have become a superhero LOL I like the one where Elsa throws snowballs and laughs and laughs! I need to watch it again tonight, been awhile. Yeah I can't believe its been about 5 years since it came out. Yes, she could be considered a super hero, no little girl would disagree! Yeah for sure! I hope we get a sequal
hmm okay. I thought the movie sounded a little childish but the voice actors makes me want to watch it. I wonder if the storyline is completely childish and cartoony. None the less, I'm interested in it.
i am doing great , just had lunch how are you ? i am good getting ready to volunteer at the animal schelter hat is great . animals are my favorite . i watched a great history documentary last night do you like history yes , i do . i prefer to read about it though instead of watching tv .

Yes, but I'm not too familiar with Rotten Tomatoes or Metacritics, so I wasn't sure how that compared to other movies they have rated. I am familiar with Rotten Tomatoes and they are a very reputable company/website! Plus to see an A+ from Cinemascore is very cool too! Yes, I was impressed with that A+. I see that one of the key scenes is when Princess Elsa possesses her magic! Sounds very cool. I wonder what cryokinetic magic is? I was wondering the same thing! It seems like you may need to be from Arendelle!

I thought ellen page did a good job with the dream construction sequences so do you think he will accomplish his goal and of dissolving the company I think the love story has an added romanticism feature that will draw in spouses to the sci fi experience There is definitely a love story in there that makes it more than just another sci fi movie

I liked Macaulay Culkin in the role of Kevein very talented kid I thought so did you know it was released in 1990 No.  I'm always behind on movie watching.  I didn't realize it was so old. do you usually watch movies based on the ratings? It had 62% in rotten tomatoes I don't usually pay attention to the ratings. So I was surprised when I saw the 62% in rotten tomatoes. But sometimes popular movies don't get good reviews by critics. yes, I guess so it was produced by John Hughes and directed by Chris columbus they did a really good job I agree that they did a good job producing the movie they did it was tense when her mother were unable to book a flight to cathc up with him yes.  any mother would be worried and tense.  he was a small kid.  Too young to fend for himself I would think. exactly but what the van owners did to her was very generous what exactly did the van owners do? sorry, the traveling polka band yes.  They were kind to let her travel with them. they offer to take her with them yes the band yes, very generous of them the movie was a bit cheesy but nice Daniel Stem played the role of Marv and was great too yes Nice chatting with you have a good day same here.  you too bye

McAuley Caukin was a cute little kid was being the word. what was your favorite part? When he fought back with The two crooks Joe Pessi was hilarious he's a great actor.
It is a pretty unique concept to be able to get information from others through their thoughts. Kind of creepy, but sounds intriguing at the same time! What did you think of the performance by Ellen Page? I agree, it is very intriguing. I thought Ellen Page did great as well. She created the dream areas, which were very fascinating. I actually didn't know before this that Christopher Nolan was the director. I'm not surprised though because of how good and iconic he is. Did you know that? No, I didn’t. I have actually never seen the movie, but it sounds good, so I might have to check it out. I like other movies Ellen Page is in, so not surprising she did well!
well you can do it later what do you do for fun ?
well that is good . ouch , my stomach hurts . why does your stomach hurt ? ?
i am great ! just enjoying the catchy tunes of the chainsmokers . you ? i am reading . i love to read me too . reading anything good ? just short stories . i have a lot of time to read
And everything gets risky when Andy's neighbor  Sid comes to the history. He is really bad for the toys. I remember I was creeped out as a kid on that part Also very funny is that in some situations Buzz really think he is a space ranger. Oh yeah. They had a very adventure trying to get back to Andy's house after all the mess. Remember the ending on Christmas?

I hope that it gets turned into a Broadway musical, I'd love to see how they would set the stage and who they would ge to play the characters Do you typically like action cartoon movies Yes I love them I do as well, frozen is probably one of my favorite Disney movies. Yeah it has been one of my more recent favorites Do you think they will make a frozen 2 Yeah I think they are in the next year or so. I'm surprised the music is so good because I know Howard Ashman didn't write the music for it Do you agree with the rotten tomatoes rating of 89% ? I think it was a fair rating, could have been a bit higher though
What do you enjoy most about the movie? I like the fact that it is a very big enemy that they must find and kill in revenge for attacking people on the beach. It's a very big mystery as to what the shark will do and if it is actually planning this or if it's just nature taking revenge on humanity. It's a nail biter lol There's no way of knowing how it will actually end and if they will actually kill the shark or be killed So even though it is an older movie, it is still worth watching? I am thinking of watching it.  And you do make it sound interesting. Absolutely, the effects might be a little dated and not as believable as modern cgi but it still has a lot of impact So you would recommend this movie to your friends? Is there anything in the movie that you did not enjoy? Absolutely, it's a great movie to watch when you want something thrilling or scary. Good movie night kind of movie. It has a bit of a slow buildup and it seems like they spend a lot of time on exposition and introduction but once they get out into water, they're in the shark's territory and it gets interesting.
cool sounds like fun ! i do not have any pets
I believe in this discussion, you don't see the document.  I'm supposed to read it and convince you to watch it based on information in the document. Patty Jenkins was the director.  I was glad to see that they picked a woman director for the film. Okay so it's your own creation Who is the music director It doesn't say on the document anything about the music.  That's a shame. The critics only scored this movie 76/100?  What do they know?  This movie deserves better than a "C". May be but it's a complete movie and I'm interested to know more about the other technicians worked in this movie too Movie Name is AVATAR I had another Wonder Woman document pop up.

honestly almost any movie produced by spielbnerg is a+ and yes a while back quite an old movie though i dont remember much about the movie though haha This one is a little lower (a-), the critics seem to like it but the users (7.9/10) not as much true, but it is also not a major Spielberg film, I agree whit the critics, and you about not a Spielberg film to remember.

Do you know the name of a good movie? Oh, OK. What is it about? It's about these two guys, Dominick and Arthur, who use experimental medical technology to enter the subconscious of their targets in order to get information that they want. Is it funny? or is it more adventure filled? Definitely more adventure filled, the genre isn't really based around humor. It's more of an action/thriller but it's great if you like that kind of thing. That sounds very interesting! Maybe I will check it out. It has Leonardo DeCaprio, right? yup he plays the main character Dominick Cobb Him and the other guy Arthur end up doing this sequence of quest where they enter people's dreams.

Oh, okay...Nick the con artist fox.  Yes he and his partner in crime Finninck are very funny. All of the animals are quite entertaining. Yes they were.  I like how the movie encourages it's viewers to look past species stereotypes. That is an intriguing aspect of the movie. Yes, it was.  However all though they were fighting stereotypes, it's hilarious how Judy tricked Nick into confessing to tax evasion into her carrot pen! They did an excellent job at personifying the animals to relate to human society. Yes, I agree.  And, I like how Nick and Judy worked together.  And, even though Nick had to be blackmailed to help Judy he still helped her keep her job when Bogo demanded Judy to resign. Are you there? We still have three more documents to go, hopefully we can get through this in a timely manner and both get paid. They didn't come together in the best way but they still helped each other out. Yes, especially when Judy learned that Nick was bullied as a child due to being stereotyped. So it seems to always come back to the them of defeating stereotypes.

Do you watch alot of musicals? Do you typically like musicals? I watch some, but I'm very picky about them Not really, I'll watch them on occasion. I don't like when they sing the dialogue
it's semi-biographical drama/dark comedy OOH about who? and who plays the lead? It's about the antics of Jordan Belfort. He is the original "wolf of wall street". Leo di Caprio plays him. He is the main one?  who plays him? Boy, I like Leo, he's been in some good biographical stories
i have not eaten yet . what do you do for work ? i am a boring accountant . i would rather play tennis . you ? i work as one too ! also leprechauns are totally real . hey might be , but i prefer red over green reen is better . i wish my hair was green , but it is dark and curly . ve you seen hamilton ? it is amazing ! i have heard good things about it . my mom would like it . too bad she went crazy oh so sorry to hear that . maybe she would still like it
I wouldn't really consider this movie black comedy, no idea why it got labeled with that genre. I noticed critics liked it but the CinemaScore, which polls movie goers, is really low. I think overall it was a pretty well received movie. r Regardless of the ratings** I will have to watch it sometime! I definitely need to watch it again sometime. Oh it was written by Terence Winter, I really like him as well. I've never heard of Terence Winter before, but I did enjoy this movie so I guess I like his work. Not really a fan of stock market movies though, that's the only downside. The quotes under critical response aren't that great either. It's a lot more than just about stocks.. There's a lot of character growth in Leo's character as well Well if it isn't focused on stocks then I will have to check it out. Seems to be very adult, mentions sex and drugs, so that could be interesting. I definitely think you'd enjoy it.. especially if you already enjoy the director The #2 scene sounds really interesting. Yeah I'm pretty sure there's a good bit of cocaine involved in the movie, if I remember correctly.
you watching sports ? i love all basketball more than football . what do you do for a living ? i work for the epa . what do you do ?

Macaulay Culkin
yeah. lol. well, it sounds like a cheesy romance - he disses her, then they meet up again months later. I agree After being rude.. he gets the girl lol. i find it comical when an actress plays an aspiring actress. i wonder if ryan gosling actually played the piano in this. I didn't think of that... and its hilarious.. only because she a well known actress it say he plays the keyboard well, they're supposed to be following their dreams but it sounds like sebastian isn't entirely following his playing music he doesn't like - doesn't sound like a dream I agree and what does she care what her mother thinks? what is she, 12? lol.

Do you also like period pieces? I guess it depends on the time period it's set in. What about you? Yeah I like them.  I also like how the 20 s  were represented here. I have to disagree with you on that one. One of the critics said it was trashy and as much as that made me laugh, it's true. That's funny.  But I did enjoy the introduction of the movie.  I like seeing the cast being introduced into their roles. Yea, they set the scene well with Jay and his doctor in the beginning I thought that Joel's take on Tom was very well portrayed.  He was quite intense. Well tom is a very intense character, he's easy to hate. Edgertor did do a great job of that with his minimal screen time. I didn't like the most critical part of the movie with the car accident. It seemed to be brushed over too quickly
do you get discounts on shoes ? my mom has 500 oh wow , that is a lot . yes , 30 yeah i only have one pair oh . i probably have 8 or 10 . yeah she takes all the shoes ! ! do you have an siblings ? i have 3 .

This is a sports drama Yes I have it was made in 2009 so a long time ago the story of , a homeless black teen November 17, 2009 yes almost 9 years pass the story of The story of Michael Oher, a homeless and traumatized boy who became an All American football player and first round NFL draft pick with the help of a caring woman and her family Rotten tomatoes gave it 69 percent Quintana Aaron plays big mike do you like
What's it about? it's a crime movie about someone called "Abagnale"  who did cons worth of million dollars by using a pan American world airways pilot , and a Louisiana parish he became so powerful that the FBI turned to him for help What do you think of that movie ?

Hi! have you seen the Blind Side before? with Sandra Bullock and Tim Magraw yes, I saw it 6 or 7 years ago I thought it was an interesting story did you see it I love it i have seen it many times. it is about Michael Oher he was drafted by theBaltamore ravens in the end I did not know it was based a a true story the first time. I went to see it becasue it had Sandra Bullock in it and had good reviews Yes, suppose to be a true story, but I am not sure how closely it followed reality THe director Hancock, I never heard of him I am sure there was embellishing to make it draw you in Based on a book written by someone? yes the book was a biography writen by Michael Lewis and the star Q Aaron, I am not sure I have seen him since The movie did not really get good reviews 6.1/10 I know Bullock got good reviews, but she always does yea the guy that played michael oher only did a few other movies and some guest spots in some series shows. yea most of her movies i like. i thought it had better reviews than it is saying. i guess it is all about who you ask What college did Oher attend ol' miss jsut like all the others
Oh yeah. I remember the 2 robbers. Have you seen the sequels at all? yes ive seen all of them, you? No. Only the first one. I was young though. I thought i heard they were going to remake it. Ahh ok, and i hadnt heard anything about that Who wouldn't notice their kid missing, right? thats what im saying pretty sad Times have changed I guess oh definitely, life is pretty weird now Do you remember where it took place? Yes, in "Peter and Kate's home outside of Chicago" I thought it was New York. that is the 2nd one Maybe I have seen the 2nd one!
ights are scary . the only think i do not like is music
Cool. Who is in it? It's one of Lindsey Lohan's best movies, I think, but also stars Rachel McAdams, Lacey Chabert and Amanda Seyfried also play really funny parts. Wow. They must have been young? Yes, it was at the peak of a lot of their careers. What is the movie about? It's a funny premise because Lindsey plays the "new girl" who enrolls at a high school that has the common cliques: nerds, jocks, etc, and these popular girls that some of the outsiders call the "Plastics." Interesting. Is the movie long? Lindsey's character, Cady, has just moved from Africa, so the whole scene is a pretty big culture clash to her. She doesn't really understand it, but ends up being roped into a revenge plot by one of the outsiders. It's average movie length, around 2 hours. Sounds odd for Lohan If you have to rate how good from 1-10 It sounds weird from what we know of her now, but she is really great in it. Like you said her peak So they are high schoolers? Right. And as the movie goes on, she moves from the innocent girl next door kind of character, to being involved in the popular girl group, and getting involved in a scandal involving a "Burn Book," which is one of those situations where the kids rate other students based on different characteristics. One of the girls ends up finding out about the revenge plot I mentioned earlier, and gets hit by a bus! Crazy stuff. You just told me the end lol I don’t need to watch it now Yes, they are all juniors in high school. Tina Fey plays one of the teachers, and she wrote the screenplay. Oh no, that's not even the end!

Oh what movie? Mean Girls starring Lindsay Lohan Was it good? Well, I love High School movies for some reason. But this was exceptional. So it was a comedy? Did it win any awards? Yeah. Hilarious. It was written by Tina Fey, not to be mistaken for Sarah Palin. Oh I love comedies, who else was in the movie? i didn't recognize anyone else. Lindsay's always in the news, so I know her. Yeah she's in a lot of good movies I dunno about awards, but I read that the critics loved it.
hank you . i also donate blood in honor of my deceased sister . do you ? o i am scared of needles . i just got the iphone but a later model . i have wanted an iphone . hey are great . my mom and dad got it for me i still live with them hey seem to be very nice . yeah they do all they can for me i am lucky to have them yes , yes you are . not all are as fortunate .
because my parents live there , i can visit and write about you oh , that would be perfect . i could tell you all about the horrid mistake i made what about music ? do you like metal ? that is my favorite . metal is pretty good ! i like progressive metal like tool what is progressive metal ? i am old school
The ratings surprise me, too. Must be due to the unrealistic traps he made and how the crooks never really got hurt. Haha yea, I guess so. Could you imagine what the movie would look like by todays standards? *promotes violence* ha ha ha haha. So what was your favorite part if you can remember? But it always seemed like the perfect revenge movie! His sibs and cousins were rotten. Yea very true, they all treated him like crap at first. I remember wishing something like that would happen to me though. Getting to just run around a big house like that and do whatever I wanted. when Kevin was praying over his "delicious and nutritious microwave macaroni & cheese" and when he told the cashier "an 8 yr old? Alone? In a store? I don't think so" (or something like that)
the critital response was overall pretty good. and it has a good story behind it yes, i didnt think that I would but I did. him and kid end up building a robot together. but they lose alot of fights Yeah, the plot sounds interesting enough its different what was your favorite scene?
watch an sports ? i have made people some moneeeeyyyyy really ? i like boxing , very popular where i am from in mexico o pets just a small business owner what kind of business do you own ? yes its popular here also , whose your favorite ?

y team is huskies because my fav color is purple . mine is steelers . . . so did you ever go to college ? i do not have kids , or a car , so i go to park nearby to watch football .
iH
do they have to dance with girls too ? i would rather read comic books you are right , it is better to enjoy the innocence of youth .
Oh there is a ton of things it has to do with, songs, movies, games, etc.
Good morning! Did you ever see this movie? Yes, I've seen it. I like Angelina Jolie and Elle Fanning. Did you like the movie? I thought it was an interesting take on the fairy tale, but I didn't really enjoy it. Interesting take on Sleeping Beauty. Sort of like Wicked with the Wizard Of Oz. Just, kind of like that. It's interesting that it got pretty bad scores on Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic, but an A on CinemaScore. I wonder if CinemaScore is paid by the studios. Yeah, it could be. Oh it has Juno Temple too. She's a good actress. Usually does indie films. Really? I don't think I've seen her in anything else. Who did she play in this movie? I'm not sure. Maybe Princess Leila? I wonder how they came up with the backstory for Maleficent. Yeah it seems like an interesting story. The background seems based partly on real historical figures. I would be pissed if I was Malificent too. I guess that's the point. It seems like a mix of history and some traditional fairy tale elements. That's good because if kids enjoy it, they may research the actual history behind it and learn some things. That's true. I used to love things like that when I was a kid, and try to find out all I could.
what kind of cake was it ? choclit all the way ! mom said to wash it down with oj my favorite juice ood ! i thought you were going to say sweet potato cake , they are gross ! yuk ! . mom made cheese n ham sandwiches too . whens your birthday ?

Sure. I agree with you. The other main character, Mia played a key role in the movie's plot I agree with the work written and directed by Damien Chazelle great I think it's sweet that Sebastian takes on a job he doesn't particularly like to prove to Mia's mother that he's going somewhere with his career. True...that's really sweet But that all fizzles out when he misses the play that she has written for a photo shoot She finds that she cannot forgive him, which ends their relationship i felt really sad. I remeber this scene where Mia runs into Sebastian at a party where he plays in a 1980s pop cover band; she teases him by requesting "I Ran (So Far Away)," a song he considers an insult for "a serious musician". After the gig, the two walk to their cars and lament wasting "A Lovely Night" together despite the clear chemistry between them. I also felt sad because it really all just seemed to be a misunderstanding Yes true. Yes, that was the beginning of the realtionship A great beginning
wow ! i love taking really cold showers ! wakes me up !
w , that sounds awful . let me guess , not compatible ? or did this person cheat ? ! he just does not like my glasses stonishing ! what a horrible , horrible man . . . he is . whats going on with you just enjoying the single life ! enjoying my 6 piece chicken mcnuggets , etc .

i have two laptops and one is getting fixed . what happened to it ? my business is computer repair . i can help .
I can't say that I have. What is it about? It's a musical set in LA.  It's a love story between a jazz pianist and an aspiring actress.  Do you like romantic comedies? I'd have to say I don't like romantic movies or musicals. This sounds like I would hate the movie overall. Does it have singing every few minutes like that movie HighSchool Musical? Ha, I know what you mean, I don't normally like romances or musicals either!  But the music works because it's part of the story.  It got amazing reviews -- even Rotten Tomatoes gave it 92%! This is probably something I'd take the wife to see. Who is in the movie actor wise? It's got Ryan Gosling, who is terrific.  And also Emma Stone. John Legend is in it too, and he does a great job. Well I like Emma Stone, always thought she was a good looker and the wife will enjoy Gosling. I assume they are the two main actors right? Yeah, they're the two main actors in it.  I bet you and your wife would both like it, it's a great date night movie. In that case, I think I could stomach it since it's got, good actors. Who is the director? The director is someone I've never actually heard of before this movie, a guy named Damien Chazelle.  Are you familiar with him?  I never heard of hm before this but I don't really know a lot of directors.

Micheal shannon, richard jenkins I only know her from this, she is very good. I really love Octavia Spencer. ph wait sally hawkins not struthers. Ya octavia spencer is always fun to watch on screen, Okay!  That is funny.  Sally Struthers played Gloria on All in the Family.  She would be pretty old now. She plays her friend at work, zelda. lol I CONFUSED THE TWO NAMES. I had seen Octavia Spencer on the preview but it did not seem like a huge role.  Do you know if she gets a lot of screen time?
Very true

Is it something you could take a child to see? I guess it depends on your style of parenting and how old they are. The movie does have sexual references and (I think) cursing. But that's to be expected in a teen comedy film. Do you know if it won any major awards? It was praised as being "comic gold". That sounds pretty good. Do you know if Tina Fey has written any other movies? I'm not sure but she has been highly praised for this film. Lindsay Lohan as Cady Heron was the main character. I don't want to get bored. Do you know how long the movie is?
i eat mostly organic , nongmo but that is about it dude . red meat builds the muscles . i did not say i was vegan , i will pay more for better beef ll my bad . yes grass feed cage free is better . so where u live ?

i am doing well ! how are you doing ? i am good thanks for asking have you watched any good movies lately ?
ope that is why i listen to country hat is a good reason . i have two brothers , three sisters
The movie got a CinemaScore of A.  The movie has a lot of slapstick humor which got a lot of praise. Kevin loves being home alone at first then 2 burglars show up and he has to defend his home. That's where the slapstick humor comes in. Ok, Who was your favorite character in the movie? Why? Kevin is one of my favorite.  I can relate to the fact that he is the youngest and always blamed for everything.  He wishes his family would disappear. What part of the story told by the movie was the most powerful? The moment when Kevin wakes up and realizes his family was gone and he was accidentally left behind.
you could be a lifeguard and drive a yellow convertible like me . i am not young i am war veteran , but i am just finishing school . lifeguard probably is not the best option then . you must be young at heart .

makes sense Sid is a really mean character in this I just read the No. 1 key scene "In a world where..." in Don LaFontaine's voice As a kid this was one of my favorite movies.  I loved the thought of the toys being alive when we weren't looking well, you need someone to be the bad guy new up date! I didn't know Sid's dog was named Scud ha I'm going to name my next dog Scud! :) This is the final scene I think yeah. there was a book...Indians in the Cupboard? that also was about toys coming alive when you weren't looking I didn't remember them getting a puppy at the end I bet he didn't name it Scud Hahahahaha

kevin is left home because a power outage caused the family to oversleep and be late for their flight so in the confusion they misplaced kevin as he was sent to the attic for misbehaving the night before So, he is not able to fend for himself?  Is he afraid? he enjoys being alone but he is met with two burglers who he has to try and strop he is not afriad but more excited How does he stop the burglars? Is it a drama or more of a comedy? the movie is a good mix of both but i would say it is more of a drama that has a good laugh once in a while What is  the name  of the movie? the movie is named home alone Ok. Does Kevin have any siblings? he has a brother named Buzz who Kevin is not a fan of since he was sent to the third floor after an altercation with Buzz the night before they left for paris Does Buzz feel bad that Kevin was left behind?

What?!  A few hours = 50 years? oh he might go down as the best of all time Which is noteworthy, as you know he has a huge repertoire, when it comes to movie personalities. he is a true pleasure to watch and i wish i knew his secret the fact that he only has one oscar amazes me yeah he doesn't just play the same character all the time Well, not everybody needs tangible things to remind them of how good they are Very good point.  And I think most people would agree he is one of the best The fans are the most important thing.  They value his work and his range. He is still young.  I see plenty more Oscars in his future

hi hey have you Dunkirk? seen? no what is that? its the movie we need to discuss then discuss cause I have nt seen it. but I see christopher nolan directed it Yep, my Favourite director it seems dunkirk was his latest project and has gotten high marks across the board I have a watched all his movies but missed out in this one yep appreciated critically and commercially after this movie DUNKIRK. I wonder why he hasnt been more mainstream frankly his movies have got lot more meaning and are more fun at the same time make me really want to figure out what other films besides DUNKIRK that he also did besides DUNKIRK. The batman series, Interstellar, Inception just to name a few are we allowed to do that? I mean it is kind of to stay on topic when both of us havent seen dunkirk so its a war movie? well then...after rewatching his first batman move i felt that he took inspirations for the first batman animation series cause the way the night life were. it was almsot always dark and yellow yes i heard the movies is depressing in here? well..it is a war film don't know how you can make it light hearted and they have germany  so... yea thats true, also Nolan isnt known for his sense of humour oh just remmbered why 1940 was so captivating. it was the start of WWII so...thats makes it even more depressing The critics have given it a rave reviews, and it has a good chance at he oscars of course I havent' caught on to what style nolan has, like michael bay and tim burton all have their styles True that I dont liike the actor in interstellar, that matthew guy. somesthing off about him
Then you should definitely watch Batman vs Superman, if you haven't already. or watch it again I've heard some really mixed reviews about it. Who are the lead actors again?
I have heard of him. Did he write the screenplay too? Yes, he did. That's cool. Did Joss Whedon produce this movie too, or does it have different producers? It was produced by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. Disney does some good movies. What about the music in this movie. Does it have good music? I don't know much about the movie score. OK. What other movies has Joss Whedon made? I couldn't really say about that either. I think the hulk character, played by Mark Ruffalo, is very entertaining in the movie. Is there anything really interesting about this movie that might make me want to see it? I do like the hulk too. Critics say it is witty and sophistocated. It's not as formulaic as you might expect from a superhero movie. That's good. I like superhero movies that are not typical. The plot centers around the God Loki and his plan to take over the Earth. He has a powerful artifact called the tesseract. Wow, that's interesting. There's a God in this movie?
puerto rican , and chinese mixed cool , are they all still alive ? where do they live ? blues music is what i do you have any hobbies , i like to flower garden rmany is where i am from , fluent in english and spanish interesting , do speak german as well ? can you speak any other languages ? ow are you doing today ? i am well , i am watching some anime and eating chocolate . how are you ? prince is my favorite artist reat i do not like music , do you like movies ? yes i do , german and americans interesting , have you been to america ?
Do you like Jim Carrey movies? Yeah, I grew up watching a lot of them and I still think they're funny and think he did a pretty good job in non-comedy too What about you? and did you like this one? I honestly feel exactly the same about Jim Carrey, and yes I liked it I thought it was a good idea I like Morgan Freeman as God Yeah, me too!  It was the first time I went to a theater to see something by him since I was a kid. Yeah I think he did a good job as god too.  It was hilarious in the movie theater hearing people when they found out who played god Did you see what this critic said? Kind of like Carrey probably nursed hopes of one day becoming a real actor." Don't think he's a Carrey fan Lol.. yeah "a real actor". Comedies are still real acting, and besides that, Eternal sunshine is still one of my favorite movies.  I don't think that was out yet though. Sounds like the typical thing a critic with his head up his ass would say , though YES I love that movie Critics love to hate
haha how about food ? what do you eat ?
i can only go three , i surf a lot though . i run daily , i usually can only do 3 if i belt out songs lol lol . my brothers have that habit as well . in school i did track and field , and won trophies , did you do sports ? i was a cheer leader and on my schools surfing and gymnastics teams . i too did gymnastics . but my passion is with running . y oldest sister was a track star , i knew better than to follow in her footsteps . it is ok to follow your own path !

I pretty much agree with your view of the movie. I USED to be a big fan of Jim Carrey. Not so much anymore though. I'll always love Jim Carrey.  I've loved him since I was a kid back in the "In Living Color" days.  There's a sequel, Evan Almighty with Steve Carrell, and they are both in a movie together called BURT WONDERSTONE. Did you know it got a cinema score of an A? I've seen Evan Almighty. Bruce Almighty is definitely better. Never seen Burt Wonderstone. I think it depends on WHO is scoring it. Critics never liked the movie but the fans DID. You should watch it.  Classic as can be.  Steve Buscemi is in it also.  That's true.  If you like certain actors, it's hard to not like anything they do. Morgan Freeman as god is pretty fun, also. lol

Yes I definitely did. I really liked the supporting cast. I thought Alfie Allen gave a really strong performance with their role. I always love plots that involve hitman I thought some of the reviews were a little tough on the film though. Did you agree with the critics? The plot itself for me with his wife being killed and him wanting revenge seemed kind of stale but it still played out pretty well in the movie. I thought some of the reviews made pretty good sense but yea others not so much Yes, I think the plot was pretty well laid out. I think it was difficult for both directors to have as much creative input as they wanted, I wonder why only one of them were actually credited on the film though? Yea thats a good question. Probably something political
The only name I recognize is Justin Timberlake! I like him both as a singer and actor. How old is the movie will it be somewhere online. It sounds like one I would like I'm not sure what the lawsuits were about. I guess the movie is based on a book about accidental billionaires. The movie came out in 2010. Columbia Pictures made it. Well know my curiousity is really peaked. I would like to know how facebook came about. Wasn't there another site like it before it came out. Thats pretty old I should be able to find it somewhere online. Have you seen it

Hi there! Hey! I remember watching Toy Story as a kid but never really thought about the voice actors. Have you seen ever seen this movie before? I definitely agree with the ratings. I think what makes this movie even more amazing is that it got such a high rating from various reviewers as the first feature-length animated film.

I'm wondering if you've seen the movie John Wick? I haven't. But I really want to watch it. I'm a huge fan of Keanu Reeves No, I have not seen it, only the trailer but it looks really good! Yeah, I didn't think it could possibly be good Me too, he is a great actor, love his Matrix! haha me too But I was skeptical about this one because I thought they were just cashing in on him from the Matrix but apparently the critics really loved it Yes, it is rated very highly very fast-paced action! One critic said "John Wick is the kind of fired up, ferocious B-movie fun some of us can't get enough of" I guess that's what the trailers made it look like it'd be. But I was watching videos the other day Keanu Reeves trained for MONTHS for this movie

I didn't know if it was part of the plot or anything.  I tend to lean towards movies that have a strong beginning to keep my attention thru the whole thing.  Does it start off slow or anything? I would say that it does start off a bit slow, but it is not too bad in that regard. It really ramps up from the middle until the end of the movie. Ok!  What other features of this movie did u like? I like the use of colors and cinematography. The movie has a colorful, saturated look to it that keeps your attention. The acting is also surprisingly strong for the type of movie this is.
i am new to the lesbian life so i do not treat her well . doing a event for my students at school maybe find a date there

I like hanks more Well they both play there roles perfectly plus it keeps you guessing the whole time ok...that's not a very compelling reason which takes really good actors to pull that off what makes the move special? Depends on what you like not every movie is going to be good for you
Same here, I find superman pretty boring. Batman is way more interesting. Yea Affleck was such a weird choice wasn't he?/ So was Lex Luthor. He was so quirky. That was a strange casting direction Yes, I definitely agree, he is spoiled and rich, but he is not a super hero. Hahaha yea I'm with you there. The same here .

It has plenty of action with lots of visually appealing CGI. The Fight scenes are well done and intense. Are there any other noteworthy actors/actresses in this movie? Yes, it has Terrence Howard, Jeff Bridges, Gwenyth Paltrow and Shaun Toub What age ranges do you think would this movie be more suitable for? It is a movie for "kids" of all ages. From five year old to the fifty year old that is younger at heart. I would say it's suitable for any audience. How long does the movie run for? Two hours and six minutes Can you describe the most memorable part of the movie? It would be when Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) discovers that his weapons are used by a terrorist or bad people. And has the epiphany to take initiative to rid the world of evil. He becomes Iron man

I always find it interesting to see what sort of demands actors can get into. I think he fit in with everyone else really well. yeah the unusual mix of actors led to a coherent mixture That's definitley true. I enjoyed seeing all of the different robot fighters in the movie s well. the new paragraph loaded reminds me of how interesting the factor that these robots were an everyday thing in the movie's world like he's just a lower-class dude but he owns a fighting robot Yeah seeing the draw of their world and how these robots are just sort of common was something that I really liked as well. I thought about what it would be like to really live in that world also interesting how it brings up the point that improved technology doesn't make all problems go away this guy still is in debt and so on
yes he is a bulldog

Sounds pretty cool! My son talked about it constantly when he first saw it. It definitely going to be on my to do list. In your opinion what is the theme of the movie? I think the movie follow the masterplot of the hero's journey, where the audience follows Gru in his attempt to achieve a long term goal of shrinking the moon. What do you think about story's involving the masterplot of the hero's journey?
because it relted to sports The Blind Side” was a massive box office hit, beloved by both critics and the viewing public. The movie raked in $300 million, earned an Oscar nod for best picture, and clinched Sandra Bullock, who starred in the film, Well I feel like the sports themes themselves were toned down somewhat and it was more like a general family drama. yes i know this is family drama Yes. I think seeing how Michael finally settled down with this family after all of the foster care drama was especially uplifting.

Sounds like it is getting more interesting when the wife finds out and then he goes out and marries again. He makes $22 million in three hours. That is impressive. Very impressive indeed. It also gets the attention of the FBI and that is not always good. So basically this guy hires a bunch of crooks to pose as stock brokers and scam a bunch of people. And then he makes a big deal for $22 million. And then he needs to run from the law. Then Saurel gets arrested in florida and turns evidence on Jordan that gets him arrested by the FBI. Three years minimum security prison? That's it for $22 million? Holy cow!
hat sounds like a fun job , i am a waitress at chili s ow is that going for you ? are you a career waitress ? its okay i am just working there til i can move out of my parents place yeah , my twin brother did something like that . you have a twin that is cool . what do you like to do in your spare time

For sure Woody and Buzz are amazing but also the other are perfect. Isn't there a few Toy Story movies? Yes for sure. On the begging the scene of Andy's party is really breathtaking don't you think? Yeah, when he first got Buzz. You still there? For sure, and the other toys are very funny Who is your favorite? Ohh difficult to say. But I suppose Mr Potato Head. And what about your? Bopeep I think And what about the scene on Pizza Planet. What a confusion, right? Yeah! but that's when the little aliens came in For sure, and also all the run to be able to get there. Really nice. And what about Andy's neighbor Sid. What a terrifying children for the toys, right? Andy's RC car is really funny don't you think? I don't remember either. Woody flying back to Andy's car is really a nice one. Have you enjoyed the end of the history? What do you mean? How the things come to the end, meaning a happy end right? Oh definitely!
hahaha Did people know that they were super heroes? The best part was Wonder Woman action scenes in the final act I love Wonder Woman
what is the move? movie?
o i am not sure what that is it is like an rpg but in real life
I have not seen it, but have been meaning to. Have you seen it? I have seen it, but it has been a while. I see a lot of reviews claiming it was the movie of the year in 2010 I found it really interesting though, especially being that it is about events that really took place. Yeah, it got nominated for a bunch of awards and everything. I'm interested in finding out how Facebook came to be but I also see that it has taken a lot of liberties with the original story. I'd still be interested though. Yeah I remember a bit about that when it first came out. Not sure what all is the real story, but I'm sure it follows it somewhat. I believe it is true that facebook came from a hot-or-not type of app though. That is so interesting, I had not looked much into it's origins Yeah I had not given it much thought until I saw the movie. Even though I do recall first using it when only college students were the target demographic Every couple minutes I get another scene to read about. So, I'm learning a little bit more as we go. Yes, I was in that same age group. Facebook first came out when I was in college. The description makes it sound like Zuckerberg is kind of a scum bag Yeah the movie played him kinda scheisty... But I could imagine that type of business deals with intellectual property issues all the time. Now I am interested in seeing it. Mainly because I feel like I only hear positive things about him. And I'd like to see the other side. Yeah. Well we also know that people can change. He might have undercut his early partners but I don't think we will ever know the whole story.
hello Have you ever seen this movie before? it is a classic would you name the movie..? Its Jaws, directed by Steven Spielberg Steven is a incredible director how is it with respect to its story..? how interesting did you find its story line..? Its a pretty good story line. The story is about a giant man-eating great white shark who attacks any beach goer. With so many attacks happening the police chief decides its his responsibility to hunt down this giant beast.
oo . i swim a lot . it is a good full body exercise .
jonathan groff plays kristoff. sometimes with my children Who play Sven? its not listed in my documents. Who play Olaf?
i liked the movie but don't think it compared to the book by F. Scott Fitzgerald of course not movie ever really captures the moment, but I do believe it emphasizes the fact that we all die alone. did you think Leonardo DiCaprio played the role of Gatsby well? He was ok but not my forte. I agree with the review that Joel Edgerton was excellent as Tom Buchanana As do I he did a real solid job with the role. did you know they filmed this in australia? Wow, did not know that. I always thought it was more of a Hampton like city. what did you think about the parties he threw pretty extravagant huh? Amazing parties, but with the wrong people. His funeral Should have been a monument with as many people that attended the parties. agreed what did you think of Daisy? A strong but extremely deceptive woman willing to do whats necessary to get what she wants.\ its a shame she had an affair with gatsby Very. I couldnt believe he admitted that he was born poor I could, to me it showed that he was able to make something out of his life . were you made that daisy and tom did not attend his funeral? mad** very, She knew he had affection for her and he was just mad that she cheated on him
after reading all that would you go watch it?

This film is also based on an original screenplay. But my favorite actor in it is the dad Christopher walken Yeah its crazy to go from check fraud to working for the fbi lol Leo is always one step ahead of Tom Hanks in this "biograpic/crime" from 2002. Christopher plays a great actor in his portrayal of Leo's dad. Have you been to New York? I was secretly routing for Leo the whole time How about you, yes I live there. How about you? Yes, I live in the state of New York. Yet, this story takes place in New Rochelle, NY. I thought it was so clever of frank to use the toy planes in the tub to put stamps on the checks. Not so easy to do something like that today I wouldn't believe lol Christopher Walken couldn't get his loan approved so Leo goes on his adventure to save him and his business. He goes to some great lengths, as you said I wish they made a sequel to this movie depicting Frank's life now and his work with the fraud department at the fbi. I wouldn't be surprised. It's based on a true story, and CinemScore rated it A Yep, I give it a 10. I have it stored on my dvr and I've seen it at least 100 times He could have faced 12 years in prison but decided to work for the FBI instead.

The movie was created in 1990. I was very young when it came out, but I don't remember seeing it in 1990. Their names are Harry and Marv. Do you remember the Dad's name? Aside from Mr. McCallister. lol yeah Do you know the popular producer who wrote the movie? but the movie rating is average in rotten tomatoes That's so peculiar to me. In my opinion it's seriously one of the best movies of my childhood. i dnt know the producer but i know the director I've only ever heard of the producer, John Hughes. chris coloumbus One of my favorite scenes is when Kevin sets up the traps and makes Harry and Marv think there's people dancing in the living room! What's your favorite scene? I cannot believe that "Rotten Tomatoes" gave it a rating of 62%. Do you agree with that rating? some what i dnt agree with that rating what about u? unfortunately my favorite scene also the same as yours As I said before, it's one of my favorite movies from my childhood. Even as an adult I think it deserves a rating of at least 85%. Actually, a rating of 90%. hmmm
Yes! specially for movie nights for Christmas holidays Okay great, I might check it out! You might know the director. It was directed by Chris columbus. Actually I do know of him. He did some of the Harry Potter films oh nice! which ones? Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone and Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets I believe they are the first two in the series. yes! I've seen those two s in the home alone movie, kevin sets a lot of booby traps to deceive the thieves which I believe makes it a lot funny but he never tells his parents about the traps and the story and still gets called out by his brother about messing his room Oh sure, it sounds like a funny situation. Anything specific you remember from the movie? well, at the beginning Kevin wishes that his family leave him alone because he had a fight with his brother but at the end, he seems very happy to get reunited with them which gives a heart-warming feeling So let me ask you a question when you want to watch a movie, how important is the rating to you? It's pretty important. I don't like to watch bad movies.
Yes, and love a thrill! Not a life for me lol But fun to watch! Definitely! I think you should give it a try. I think my husband would enjoy it as well, wonder where I can find it these days? Do you want to know the ending? Blockbuster by us has closed No, I think I will try finding it and seeing for ourselves how it ends I'm glad I could be of assistance. I hope you enjoy it! Thanks for the recommendation! It isnt a movie I'd usually pick off the self Tell me how you liked it and I will be sure to recommend more next time. shelf

I think Luther just wanted to give Superman a reason to kill Batman AND feel bad about it. Basically telling Superman "Hey, I made you guys hate each other but you never needed to, and now you have to kill him." I'm not sure how Batman could be confused about Martha, as his mother is long dead.

o the play football and basketball
Rotten tomatoes gives it 59 percent. I guess that means they say it's an ok kind of move. I remember the boxing robots though. The deal where the winner gets the loser's robot seems a bit extreme Lol. I see the movie was filmed totally in Michigan. Good for them. Tax credits. Yeah, that was nice while it lasted. Seems to have dried up though I live in Ohio and I hear about those "credits" for movies being made here. Normally I'd watch Hugh Jackman in other movies. He's a decent actor.
hat is great . got to run off the fats though finally i escaped being a cook went to school . hat is nice . gotta get a camera 10 years later i got married . i was once a photographer .
i have never had a problem with them cold long as the bag has not been opened yet
Yes, I agree. Although, he did end up with a very loving family. I think we could attribute that to his marriage to collins which had a good backing from Ann Yes. They eventually get a tutor for Michael, and he improves his schooling drastically. I think Michael got lucky, because not many would have such person come an inch near their family given his records of having a drug addict mother You could say he got lucky, but I think Sean and Leigh Anne did a great job. It is very kind of tuohys to do all that for him Yes. He does go back to see his mother and runs into some trouble. That is typical of a growing man I suppose, but good for him he could retrace his steps and fight for the Tuohys I agree. He eventually picks Ole Miss for his College. wait a minute michael was never married to collins I made that mistake up there,Collins was actually a friend imagine someone who was deemed to be academically retarded Yes, I was confused for a second when you said that. He decides to go to Ole Miss, since his adoptive family went there. But I don't understand why the cinema gave it such rating You don't agree with the A+ rating? the set up does not look spectacular to me Yeah, I don't I thought it was decent.
it is ok , eventually you will get use to it . i work with animals . i prefer them . people are okay . do you have any pets ? imals are cool . i am not a big people person either . people are really mean . right ? ! i like you . do you read ? i read a lot of crime novels . very mysterious . ot really a ready , i prefer smoking weed and working as a it agent . it shows . sorry . i am still bummed out . an alligator bit off two of my toes . what a bummer . should of wore steal toe boots . it was a steal toe alligator . you eat breakfast ? i eat eggs for breakfast . lots of eggs . oh , and yeah i do . more like pancakes and protein shakes . pancakes are people food . i eat animal food . like an animal . i like animals a lot . i am sure you do , you keep talking bout them

Hey, Jaws is a pretty good move if you're looking for something to watch no i when this movie edited I haven't a clue. It came out int 75
I'm a big fan of super hero movies. So in order of greatness: Dark Knight, Batman vs Superman, and then Man of Steel? I would say yes to that. CinemaScore gave it a rating of B which is what I agree with. Are you a fan of Ben Affleck? I'm a fan of Ben Affleck. Where does the rate for a Ben Affleck movie? I honestly couldn't say, but he played Batman/Bruce Wayne and of course, is manipulated into battle with Superman! Who is the villain of the movie? It's Lex Luthor - he's the one who manipulated Batman into battling Superman. Have you heard of Jesse Eisenberg? I have heard of Jesse Eisenberg. He's in the film? Lex Luthor is the main antagonist? Yes he is! He plays Lex Luthor of LexCorp. He's a bad man! He tried persuading a senator into importing Kryptonite claiming he wants to use it as a deterrent against potential Kyrptonian threats. Of course, his persuasions were unsuccessful.
yea . that awesome . i try to help with my sense of humor . lift them up i also garden . that could help keep their minds off things too .
I am not sure on that but spielburg is blessed with talent many moviemakers dont posses.  He actually know how to tell a story! He did make many good movies.  What are some of your favorites?  Was this the first time you saw Jaws? Yes, it was the first time.  To gruesome for children to watch. I think I was pretty young when I saw it the first time.  I remember blood, but not all the gruesome scenes.  I doubt my children have seen it.
hat . to each their own . i do not like talking to people , i sleep all day and work all night . yeah and that is okay . too . you can always listen . i guess , yes , that sounds oaky people really need good listeners as well as talkers . i do not know how to act when listening , it is awkward

Yea, they did a really good job with the action scenes I did like the Coulson death scene as a motivational factor. The way Fury handled it was priceless. Yea, it made sense in the context of what was going on. The Hulk beating Loki senseless was great. Yea!  It was a highlight for me as well.

cool. i know it was very popular with kids. i guess i'm supposed to end the conversation now? Yeah, lol, it won't let me end it, I think we have to have six dialogues each? I'm not sure Frozen made Kristen Bell very popular, little girls everywhere sing the theme song oh sorry i got confused, i thought it said three. Haha. Ohhhhh it was Kristen Bell! I knew the theme song was very popular but i didn't know who else was in it. Anybody else famous? Oh oops three each. Got it. I'll close now :) Wait it's saying I can't end it yet. Never mind. lol, it has Livy Strubenrauch, Agatha Lee Monn and Idina Menzel They say it's destined to become a broadway show based on it's popularity. (First mturk chat for me) Interesting. Well, I'm not that into animated movies or musicals but maybe if I have to take a kid to a movie I can see it. Definitely more of a childrens movie. But gets great viewer perception all around. It is one of Disneys best animated musicals since the death of  the great lyricist Howard Ashman who did the little mermaid and beauty and the beast. It keeps saying if I end the conversation while the other user is still in it and acting normally, i won't get compensation. :O Ugh, it won't let me click finish either. The finish conversation tab has a red circle with a line. I must've misunderstood the instructions Yes same here! I thought it was, three comments each for each movie and 4 movies so 12 responses total Yeah, you're right My screen just changed It still has Frozen as a topic Weird Yes, definitely.

I suppose all that blowing up stuff makes up for the poor acting some. he does act like that a lot but it fits the charecter this time Jeff B is looking pretty old these days. He was the bad guy in the film I think Yeah explosions are awesome. Explosions are great when nothing is really blowing up too. lol it was weird seeing bridges play that role that but he so underated.

Well that just gave me leverage to get my hubby to watch. Proof his man card won't be ripped away lol Made by the same guy who made Hellboy, Pans labyrinth and pacific rim, not really love movies so it was pretty shocking to see him handle this kinda movie so well. I'm a big movie lover so I usually know all these useless facts about them I'm the same way with music I can tell you all about a song and the lyrics stick with me forever but don't ask me who sings it or the title lol. Isn't there another movie or 2 you want to talk about?
Absolutely, another character that Fitzgerald managed to make leap of the page, doing much the same in the film version. Did you liked the car,the white limousine Absolutely, a style icon of the 1920s brought to life with startling vivacity, just one of the many set dressings that this film got entirely correct. It was filmed in Australia Production started 2011
I thought it was delaying the inevitable and giving them a false sense of accomplishment. I agree, I felt bad for Mike who thought he succeeded on his own terms but instead was helped to win

The last one made me cry! The first one is usually the best one What did you think of Tom Hanks in it? Well its Tom Hanks so can you ever really go wrong? I love that he makes Woody so unique and makes him stand out aside from the point that he is a main character. Who is your favorite character in the movie? It is so hard to pick! Probably Woody, but Buzz is great too The way they play off each other is great! I love Slinky Dog. YESS!! And Rex! With his tiny arms!! LOL Do you like the way the story was resolved? My next key scene is where Andy goes to Pizza Planet and Buzz and Woody manage to hitch a ride on the pizza truck and have their encounter with Sid. First off Sid and his creepy toys scared me as a child. Lol.

I liked the scene when Cheif Bogo assigned her to parking duty, it is funny. Do you intend to see this movie in the future? Ooops I did see it.. Sorry I misunderstoof/ was thinking about a different movie. My family thoroughly enjoyed Zootopia especially teaching that even a bunny can be a police officer! Very funny and inspiring movie! That is quite alright, I really enjoyed it as well. I was laughing more than I'd care to admit. The foxes were also great. Do you agree with the ratings? I always seem to get caught up in childrens movies especially when they are funny. Yeah I think the ratings were right on at 98% and 8/10! I also have to agree, I thought it was an original way to teach kids about stereotypes. Yes definitely! That is a good lessen for children to learn especially in this way! What did you think about Otterton going "Savage"?
Today we are gonna talk about The Great Gatsby/ Have you seen it? It was published in 2013. Surprisingly I think I heard of it but never seen it. You? yea already been 5 years. I read the book and watched it. Do you know who plays Gatsby? Leonardo DiCaprio Did you like it? It had its moments for me. This is a romance drama film

That's right. Can you tell me more about the movie? It’s the first movie in a trilogy and I think they may be making another one in the near future. At least that’s what my kids tell me I know that I've seen at least the first two.  I'm not sure if I've seen the third one.  I don't think that I've heard anything about a new one. My kids are grown, and I don't have any grandchildren yet. Well, they have an excellent cast of voice actors. Tom Hanks is the voice of Woody, he’s a cowboy toy. And Tim Allen is the voice of Buzz Lightyear. Those two are the main characters Do you know any of the other voice actors? They start out as enemies in a sense and then become best friends It does take them a while to get to know each other and to adjust to each other. I think that a lot of us are that way when we meet someone new. Yes John Ratzenberger the guy who played on cheers also is a voice actor in the movie. He plays ham who is a little piggy bank very cute
yes ! i love the pumpkin coffee creamer . my cats drink that stuff if i am not careful ! lol ine do too ! they are like coffee addicts !
only if i put my heart into it your heart must be stong then do you work out
Hi so Zootopia Is an animation about animals living like humans. Judy Hopps from rural Bunnyburrowfulfills her childhood dream of becoming a police officer in urban Zootopia. Despite being theacademy valedictorian, Judy is delegated to parking duty by Chief Bogo, who doubts herpotential because she is a rabbit. On her first day, she is hustled by a con artist fox duo, NickWilde and Finnick.
wonderful . just visiting the mountains . i love the mountains . rockies or smokies ? ppalachian mountains actually . what do you do for work ? i am a waitress at hooters i like their deep fried pickles . but very unhealthy . oh yeah , we do not have many healthy options there lol i work as a surgeon . so i try to stay healthy . oh wow , i love watching greys anatomy with my daughter hat is a good show , . i have not watched since a main character died . mcdreamy ? i miss him so much yes , i am watching supernatural now though . i am usually doing school work online , hard to find time to watch tv yeah i have the tv when my children are at school .

i do not . how about you ? i have four . what size car do you have i have a mid size sedan .
wow Also, a funny note, this person became so good at check fraud, the FBI actually asked him to work for them and detect bank / check fraud. How crazy is that?! Happens all the time though. that is crazy You know, he specifically targeted Pan Am payroll checks and impersonated an airline pilot to do this. He stole around 2.8 million dollars doing this. no wonder he got caught Dicaprio's character is based on this person named Frank Abagnale Jr, they also have problems with the IRS before they start doing their scams. You know Christopher Walken? He Actually plays Frank Abagnale Sr in this movie? Pretty cool huh? CHristopher Walken is awesome Yes, When Frank finally gives himself up and is sentenced to 12 years in prison, but he mentions a check Carl hasis fake, who is Tom Hanks FBI character. This is how they work a deal and he works for the FBI now, or else it would be 12 years in the slammer! wow that's scary You know? Frank's Dad was denied a loan from Chase Manhattan Bank, perhaps this is how Frank started doing check fraud. could be What makes it worse, Frank's mom is carrying an affair with the best friend of her husband or Frank's Dad. Bad times in paradise! omg Funny fact here, Frank is making millions now after the movie working with the FBI, by making sure money forgers are caught and creating unforgeable checks in the process. Frank Abagnale grew up in New Rochelle, New York with his dad and mother Paula. I did not know that!
o , but i have fallen hard for a girl who has no idea . pumpkins taste good . you eat the seed ? you should not eat seed , says my parents who are physicians . ver had shrimp and bbq sauce ? its great . bbq sauce is so pretty when i smear it on the wall . i read pdfs and stuff . do you ? being a doc i have no time . i just read x rays . i have a youtube channel and watch it all the time . you ? o , like i said , i am more into acting than watching .
small game mostly . if you like hunting critters
yes chasing your dream is good advice climb every mountain . . . for me , the mountains are the dream haha sound of music ? good movie yes ! i love music too mostly folk music . you ?
Do you believe Facebook escalated pretty quickly? as in it expanded? I do believe it took off quickly. However I don't like how sometimes people use it to expose people like Erica Albright. Do you think  would be as big a hit as Facebook Was there a book written after this movie has been filmed? Facemash Who did you support? Mark or the Twins? It was from the book The Accidental Billionaires: The founding of Facebook Was there a known singer participating in the cast of this movie? I support Zuckerburg. There are always people who want to take credit for the things they did not do. Justin Timberlake played Sean Parker. Why do you think Mark tried contacting Mrs. Albright? I think he wants to make a mends Do you believe David Fincher filmed was considered a rare quality movie?
i love to cook just like my dad did ii love to cook too i live on the coast of florida i live in portland oregon fishing is my hobby and my job y hobby is panting and like to paint my nails green my dad worked as a cook , bartender . too hard for me so i fish .
I was surprised about those too. This is one of the few movies that I can re-watch. I couldn't believe how good Tom Hanks was, too. Did you watch it back in 2002 when it first came out or later? I mean for the first time I also like how in the end he misses the adrenaline rush so much that he is back to fraud I watched it later. Years later. Right? When you're better than the government it's probably hard to resist the urge haha I guess it is also about that statistically he got away more often than he got caught And I also like how in the end he gets to create those unforgeable checks So true Oh, he was really good. That's for sure. it's like those stories when IT security companies hire hackers who manage to find and exploit some holes in the code
Hi, how are you? good! how are you? good, thank you are you curious about the movie? Which movie is it? maleficent what's it about? it's a superhero movie cool, I like those who's in it? angelina jolie plays the main character it's loosely based on the sleeping beauty That sounds interesting. Did you like it? yes does it have a good plot? yes it's very interesting, i like how the they take a twist on sleeping beauty by showing you the antagonist fairy's side That sounds like a really cool angle I like a good anti-hero also it's heartbreaking because her childhood love ends up becoming the king/father of the sleeping beauty princess. and the king tries to kill her and he cuts off her fairy wings. that's when the fairy becomes dark wow! It sounds like a dark take on a fairy tale however, she ends up growing fond over princess aurora, who starts to call her "fairy godmother".  it shows you angelina jolie's dark character is not so dark after all It sounds like something I would love yes it's super cool! you should watch it when you can I like a anti-hero's back story why exactly they turned into the person they did it got an A grading on CinemScore Sounds good
om and jerry and i am watching it right now
hi what is the name of the movie Dunkirk can you tell about the movie genere I have not seen it yet have you?
hat would not be fun at all
ood morning , how are you ? pretty tired , but ok . how are you ? same , lol . the indians kept me up last night at least they won . rolltribe ! ! i am a big indians fan ! oo , lol . i hated baseball until i met my husband . now even our kids love it . i was raised in a baseball house . converted my husband to a baseball fan ! ine was any and all forms of racing . very nice . how long have you been married ? wenty years . we married young .
Oh, wow, this is a very different ending. I like it. It's not all about the prince and the princess. So why does this Stefan fellow betray Maleficent? I am trying to understand his motivation Maybe because she is becoming close to Aurora? Not getting it either. Seems like so much trouble could have been avoided if he had just acted normally And he winds up dead because of it. Geez Nice chatting with you.
i take public transportation so an express bus .
sounds interesting. what was a key scene in the movie? It's super interesting, I'd definitely recommend it. An interesting concept. I don't want to give too much away, but there's a lot of fairy tale themes and drama where a lot of people are trying to kill Maleficent. Any other questions? so you would say it was a movie worth watching? was the acting good? Yeah definitely! You won't see many other movies like it. And yes definitely, Angelina Jolie steals the show. sounds like a pretty cool movie. did you have a favorite scene?
uess all the languages i know would be something to brag about . any kids ? yes i would be . yes i have three . how about you ? ope not yet . hope to settle down one day , but the business life has me now . you will get there one day . whats most important to you right now ? rying to track down my parents so i can one day meet them . you ? oh good luck to you . my kids of course . where did you grow up ? ll over the place . you ?
no, I'm not into Batman movies... Were you told whether the movie got any awards (for directing, cinematography, acting) - this could affect my decision... (That was the year I graduated high school) I see... So what about the movie's awards? Any info? No only that it was  a 7.7/10 on rotten tomatoes and an A for CinemaScore Are you a fan of Nolan? that's quite a good score... I remember Stephanie Zackarek, a film critic I usually agree with, is usually harsh about such big movies. Were you told what was her opinion about the movie? No she is not listed directly. Nolan directed movies such as Interstellar, Inception and most recently Dunkirk no, to be honest I don't care about Nolan. and I don't usually like big movies. the one with Daniel Craig and that French actress is probably the only big movie I liked in the last years. I meant James Bond' movie with Daniel Craig... Does the movie you were told about has any other female actresses listed than Katie Holmes? _other than_ Katie Holmes I mean
been busy today . my son and i went to the park and had fun do you enjoy spending time with family ? yes , i do . being 25 i am busy in general . the military keeps my real busy well that is good my family just some dirty old cunts since i used to be a wrestler when i was in hs maybe i should come over ood you can put some whores on the floor i like it ot so sure i could do that i do it everyday aka getting laid no jk i am way too shy
ot much since i am having trouble eating . . . you probably should eat vegetable soup then
No really. Do you generally watch movies with bad plots like La La Land Not really, I don't really like musicals all that much. I wasn't really a big fan of the ending, to be honest. Me neither. Do you agree with the rating the movie got? To be honest, I think that it's a little high for what the movie deserved.
i read plenty of books about cooking when i am bored hat is good ! i am a stay at home mom , so i get bored , too , sometimes . i write poetry too . helps with the trama i got as a marine oh , wow . i hope it helps . i like a good run , that helps me . yea , i bartend and get to vent all the time

Rian Gosling action unbelivable IMDB 8.1/10 Yep i liked him too Director Damien Chazelle giving nice movies I specially like the part where Seb plays the Jazz improv yes i like whole movie it was really good, nice that it won awards also Yes The critics had given it a above average ratings It is one of a Philippines movie
so you grow your own potatoes yes she that i make sure that it is no preservatives like that
i like gospel music . what about you ?
Yes, there are two sequels to the original and those are just as great. It's definitely added to my list of ones to see! Is it easily rented online? Great!  You will really enjoy it I'm sure. Yes, you can find it through your service provider or through a streaming service such as Netflix or Hulu. Cool! I have those so I will check that out. Perfect!
oh that is nice . . . i do not get to work out much . it is a good time for me to listen to metallica . do you listen to music ? yes , i listen to music while i paint . oh painting ! what do you like to paint ?
My best friends girlfriend is going to make me watch Mean Girls later She's in total disbelief. Yeah it is kind of crazy you haven't seen it.  It really has everything you'd want.  Lohan's character is pretty awesome.  As a viewer I loved the plot against the Mean Girls to teach them a revenge. did you go to a public school I did until until my algebra teacher disrespected me in front of the whole class so I slapped him up side his head and went to online. Wow! Lohan's character had been homeschooled up to this point so operating with all the various cliques in a public high school was new to her.  How did you deal with cliques in school I made my own cliques with friends that also didn't care about anything. but after a school event called Challenge Day I feel it really impacted the way the whole school treated eachother
i am completely deaf but i love playing tennis . does being deaf hurt your game ? i would hate to clean up after a game . yes , i like all people . no , it does not . i am pretty good i would like to play you ! can we play on a blue court ? yes , blue is a lovely color ice ! it is definitely my favorite . would you like to paint with me ?
So how do you think Christian Bale is in the role of Batman?  Do you like his style of playing the character? Honestly, i think he is my favorite batman yet I think he can really play both batman and bruce wayne an actor must fill both roles to play a great batman. I have to agree.  The document this time mentions exploring Batman's damaged psyche.  I think that Christian Bale did a particularly good job at that, really made me feel how tormented Bruce Wayne is. Yes, I agree. Bale is particularly good at playing characters that have deep emotions. They did a great job with the rest of the series too. The soundtrack was phenomenal as well And what about the scene from when he was a child and fell into the well and was attacked by a swarm of bats?  I thought that really added to my understanding of the character and truly appreciated that scene. And yes, the soundtrack was excellent! that scene was fantastic it helps give a great undertsnading of where his fear came from I like alfred as well. He adds a nice balance to the eccentricity and flamboyancy of bruce wayne Yes it does.  I also loved the scene where Bruce's parents were killed in front of him outside the theater when he was a child.  I found it very moving and it made me very sympathetic to him and to his origins of becoming Batman. I love Alfred as well, I have always loved Michael Cain and I think he's fantastic in that role. Michael cain played a fantastic alfred I agree with you as well about the scene at the beginning. seeing him go through that as a young character really paints a solid backdrop for the character that he becomes I found the scenes about Bruce's training with the League of Shadows particularly interesting.  When Bruce discovered that they were planning to destroy Gotham and he burned down the temple to prevent this, I thought that was a great sequence.
Makes sense, Nolan has the vibe on lock. I really liked how he managed to pull the whole "dream within a dream" feel in this one. yeah, it was one of my favorite action flicks ever the cast and the story are both top notch. I love when they go into limbo at the end jesus its literal jesus level material right there That was probably my favorite part. Holding them there for a chance to slow down the impact. its got that "matrix but more serious" vibe. The movie made you think. I love how it didnt leave you confused about the plot like so many movies now adays not many movies can compare to this one christopher nolan may be better than JJ Abrams. Just a personal opnion though
whats your fave pizza ? surfing and ladies are my hobby !
I never trust the ratings or opinions. I have to see a movie from my point of view
Hi there Hello So the movie you need to watch is Despicable Me. That sounds like an interesting title. Can you tell me about the plot of the movie? This particular page doesn't dive too much into the plot, but it has a rotten tomatoes score of 81% with a 6.8/10 average. Okay What is the score? Can you tell me anything specific about the movie? Its a animated movie with characters voiced by Steve Carell, Jason Segel, and Russell Brand So it sounds like it might be a funny film? Are you still here? Yes, sorry Is this a G-rated movie? That information is not listed, but I would guess its probably PG If you have or had kids, would you feel comfortable taking them to see it? For sure.  One critic even says Kids will dig it and adults will smile with amusement The plot revolves around a super villian named Gru who wants to steal the moon Hmm. Does it seem like it has sci-fi involved?
You should rewatch it. It's so good. Did you like Leonardo DiCaprio in it? He is a great actor, I love his performance in that film Usually biographical true stories aren't my thing but it was so entertaining. What did you liked the most about the film ? I just liked all of the different cons he does. Like when he pretended to be a pilot and a doctor. The beginning is funny too, when he pretends to be the teacher in his own class. It has been a long time since I have seen the film, is there a reason to see it again ? Well it has a 96% fresh score on rotten tomatoes They are usually right, it must be a good film.  Does the film stays funny or it takes a dramatic turn ? It gets darker in the end for sure. His cons start falling apart I think when he falls in love with the nurse in Louisiana but she refuses to run away with him. That is quite a downer, who are the others actors ? Tom Hanks is the detective who is after him and Christopher Walken is his dad. of the detective or the conman ? sorry, I misread you sentence What is the role of the dad ? What does he brings to the story ? Haha it's cool. The dad's money problems are what inspire Frank to start conning people. He dies later in the movie. His death is part of the reason why Frank decides to end the chase. Ok , it seems a good story with characters with more than one motivation. I like complexe characters Yeah me too. It's based on a real guy so it has to be complex. It has a satisfying ending too. do you feel that some elements in the story were added to make it more interesting ? Probably the dramatic details. But the overall story is true, the dude actually got away pretending to be a pilot, doctor, and lawyer. He made millions forging checks. What did you liked about the ending ?
Oh, who was she? Also a main character? It was Elsa's younger sister Oh okay. Were there any animal characters apart from the reindeer? Umm I don't think so or can't recall that there were. Oh I see. Well, the characters all sound interesting and the movie sounds a lot of fun! Thank you very much for sharing your thoughts and the reviews
horror movie . i am more of a rock person . cool , what did you do in your spare time mostly video games . how about you ? i run and try do physical activities since i serve in the navy hat is amazing ! how long have you been serving 7 years to be exact it has been a great and challenging experience i can only imagine . no one in my family has served .
Yes he has just the right voice and persona to pull it off don't you agree? Yeah, definitely. I don't know why so many of the ratings of the movie were kind of mediocre. The ratings were a bit unfair, it's an underrated movie for sure. I didn't remember that Jennifer Aniston was in Bruce Almighty.
i have two dogs ; bully breeds . it is hard to live in the city with them . yeah , people get nervous around them . . . what do you like to do for fun ?
i have traveled to canada , paris , london and several us states
I loved Keanu Reeves when I was younger.  I don't know if I'd be interested in this type of movie though It's more of a B-movie type genre, but it has a modern edge. He's really evolved as he has gotten older. John Leguizamo is great in it also. I guess it's a matter of being in the mood for Keanu's delivery I do like action though so maybe that powers it through That's definitely true. His deadpan humor style works really well in John Wick though. I'm really into action movies also and this movie really starts and ends with it. It catches your attention right away. Are you a Willem Dafoe fan? He is in it also. I read in the synopsis his puppy is killed.  I have a hard time with animals dying in films.  I do like William Dafoe. It has gotten good reviews on rot Rotten Tomatoes
Yes I do!  I was surprised at the low rating by rotten tomatoes for this one. I thought that Calaulay Culkin did a great performance Me 2!  Joe Pesci was great as well as Harry. Yes- The burglars were also great in this omvie I know, right!  I also enjoyed Catherine O'Hare and John Heard as Kevin's parents Who was your favorite character? Marv for sure! What about you? I think Kevin was my favorite I felt sorry for Kevin when he got left at home in the confusion Can you believe that they forgot him on their way to Paris for Christmas? it was quite sad I know!  The power outage didn't help in the confusion Especially because he is the youngest Yes, he must have been quite surprised when his "wish" came true I bet Kate was very desperate to take a ride with the polka band No kidding.  She made it to Pennsylvania ans was determined to get home. Christmas is always a crazy time to travel Yes, but it would be nice to travel to Paris. The booby traps in the movie are my favorite part! Kevin was so clever to make booby traps because he knew he couldn't overpower them physically He was lucky that Marley was there with his snow shovel at the end I bet Kevin was so happy when his family finally came home Do you think Buzz was mad about his room?
yes , i juggle fruit all day preparing for my circus act . wesome . i am like obsessed with sharks i got in the circus business through my grandfather and dad . oh that is interesting . some say i have a witty attitude sharks are beautiful creatures to look at . hey are . i love when they attack . . best part i am totally afraid of sharks . hey are actually pretty nice once you get to know them

i agree very entertaining although it is a cartoon in a way it is relatable I agree with you. I think that it shows that we can find unlikely friendships in those that we may not like at first and can find similarities in those that we feel we are different from. yes so true usually we meet people at first and not really get along but along the way, we end up being friends with them Absolutely. I think this is a great way to teach children these lessons without them realizing it and it's a great way to remind adults of these lessons as well. As adult we also learn that things dont always go as planned we go to universities hoping and planning to study something and usually end up changing our major multiple times
I have mixed feelings. I really want to take in foster children but I'm concerned about the effect on my own child. I have seen families ripped apart by taking in foster children. Two completely divorced, broke apart and the biological children were messed up by it.
your very insightful Do you think they should have broken up when he missed her play? I'm not sure.  I think ultimately it was good for them. It would have been disingenuous for her to act against how she felt -- both of them were such emotional people who made decisions based on strong emotions What did you think of her decision to go home?
doing well . any big plans for today ? i am going to make some brownies sounds delicious . where are you from ? i am from the great us of a oo . play any sports ?

o . do you speak other languages ? mandarin . china will own the 21st century
do you have pets ? i have a dog yes i have three cats
I believe it takes place in a Metropolis yes. Diane lane is martha kent. She is the star When did the movie release? as you can tell, I am very familiar with this movie. It has a rating of 27 percent on rotten tomatoes, which is indicative of its quality this movie premiered in 2016 it is also in color, I believe jessie eisenberg is lex luthor, the might villain Does one of the characters, either batman or superman die in the end? its 153 minutes long
? what will you be going for ineering . i dropped out because my grandparents needed help . ww , i live with both my grandpa and grandma . do you live with yours ? i live with my parents . i had a stay at home mom . i am changing my major to nursing soon . do you do anything fun ? watch movies and sometimes help my dad . he sold insurance before .
It does. Now I have the urge to watch it again lol Good thing I still have it on DVD I've always hated the way parents intercepted relationships the way Anne did. Keeping people apart based on money.
just some games . my team and i have designed over 65 video games .
Good.  I prefer movies to be 2 hours or less.  What did you find most interesting about the movie? I find the code-cracking to be very interesting in itself.  The story itself was also dramatic and compelling. Very good.  Where was Turing from?
i am a stay at home mother with a seven year old . oh how old are you ? i am 34 and my daughter miah is seven .
i loved it back when i was younger . i would love to live on a house boat . the water and beach are awesome .
indeed , is a little know fashion trend we have up the appalachian trail ! i like it , it also works well for october . . breast cancer awareness month yes and it affects men and women . at my age i have developed man boobs .
I liked it even more cause it was baces in my hometown chicago Ah yeah it's always fun to recognize streets or landmarks that you've been to in real life, in a movie haha yes it was so true to home. Hah I didn't remember the scene with the temporary power outage and that being the reason why Kevin was accidentally left home alone ha ha. I always wonder how parents could leave the kid at hom ein the first place that's a solid point Perhaps that's the reason why RT gave it a low score was because of how "unrealistic" it was, but like I said they have given so many bad movies a great rating. and they usually weren't any more realistic but the they leave him alone after that there are more movies it really is a fun movie to watch
oh , do you enjoy cooking ? my wife is always trying new recipes too . yes ! i am currently a personal chef , but would love to open a restaurant one day cool . what kind of a restaurant would you like it to be ? various types of cuisine . i imagine painting the walls in a hunter green . my favorite color hat sounds nice . maybe someday my family could eat at your restaurant . i would love that . what do you enjoy ? y tastes in food are quite varied . as are my tastes in video games .

hello, how are you? Good Thanks! and you? Great, thanks for asking! Do you know the name of this movie? The name is Despicable Me Oh, I love that movie! Do you like animation comedies? Have you seen it before? Not usually, but this one was very funny and cute! My kids loved it and I enjoyed it as well I have! This movie is filled with great comedians such as, Steve Carell, Jason Segal and Russell BRand! I know, I loved the comedy in it! Russell Brand was great! I loved Victor character, the awkward geek with funny Transylvania accent! and the story of the three adopted kids was very touching! and of course the Minions- kids love them! Its no first rank CGI cartoon, but shows how Pixar's quailty over crass is inspiring the mid-list. Its definitly a fun movie for kidas and fresh for adults! Its even in 3D Yes, because there are so many foolish animations out there, but this one is very fresh and innocent!
and Jennifer Aniston is one of the actress as well I love how Morgan Freeman acts, his the best

I think he did a great job. He took a regular villain and turned him into someone you could root for. What did you think of Dr. Nefario? I love Russell Brand so I found him hilarious. Do you agree it was a good movie for both kids and adults? I was honestly surprised when I found out Russell Brand did the voice for him. I really do. I enjoyed it and I know the kids I know loved it too. I agree. I think the reviews were spot-on. What did you think of the animation style? I thought it was really interesting. Maybe not as good as Pixar, but still enjoyable. What did you think about the scene where the Great Pyramid was stolen? I honestly thought it was a pretty good gag and it really set up Gru's character to me. I could see that. But I thought it was just a bit far-fetched. The whole shrink ray setup did not really appeal to me. Did you like the transition to trying to steal the moon?
Yeah, they're all amazed when they get home that he was actually able to take care of himself I watched it recently with my kids and they loved it I'm sure we'll be watching it again next holiday season i watched alone only but good one thank you I think there was a Home Alone Part 2, but not sure

A dog being killed!?  Idk if I can watch this lol but it was well played out masterfully though for some reasons humans dying in movies is okay to watch but i have a serious soft spot for dogs oh u u will...they didnt show the dog being shot at directly..u know these movie directors they always want to watch out for everyone's interest Yeah but like, is there audio of it crying or yelping?  I feel so sad when they do that lol Even though I know it's not real lol Is this a movie series? John wick have been out of business for so long...he is the best assasin in town ..and all of a sudden the mafia's young son want no other car in the whole town..only john wicks its not a series Oh well that's unfortunate for them... but fortunate for us I suppose lol he was warned by everyone that its a no go area even by his father but he wouldnt listen

Do you like a lot of superhero movies? I suppose. I did really enjoy guardians of the galaxy Me too, and I liked the Thor movies. I never really read comics though. So I don't know anything about DC or Marvel really. Bruce Wayne falls into a well of sorts and was attacked by a bunch of bats and developed that phobia. I guess he became Batman to fight that fear and have a greater purpose in his anger Same here about DC and Marvel I heard that DC has more characters that have more relatable lives and have more unrealistic heroes while Marvel is kinda the opposite The superhero genre is very popular now although it used to be thought of as "nerdy." New superhero movies are usually the summer blockbusters each year
well i work at google its been a good job so far

She actually has revenge on her but when she sees her beautiful face and shown pity on her is very practical and heart touching. it is very touching to see the love she has for the child in the end Yes i love those scenes.. When Stefan afraid of her curse is a wonderful scene though It is good to see him afraid for what he has done Yes that too when he go for war, and Maleficiant fight and magics are truely awesome How do you like Stefan act here? i think he did a good job. I liked the story the two had and how he betrayed her and she cast a spell on his daughter to get even with him. I really like how strong a character Maleficiant is. She is done wrong and takes things into her own hands. yes every woman should be like Maleficiant, should come back even in distress.. But she lost the wings she born with. That is really bad to realize. And though she was in love with stefan at one time which turned to hate she loved his daughter It is but she figured out how to be strong without them After watching the movie i wish have such wings to fly around.. why only birds or farries have wings?
yes , i have dong and donkey donkey ? animals are one of my obsessions oh , what is your hobbies i love to hike , i also teach yoga classes

I'll have to check it out. Netflix? I'm not sure Not a huge Leo fan.. Haha, in that case you may not enjoy it. he was pretty cool wrestling that bear in his latest though He is definitely a critical character in the movie I have not seen Revenant Although I have heard a lot about that scene come to think of it Elen Page i liked when she was young, now she kinda annoys me. She definitely seems to rub some people the wrong way I like her acting style She was funny in that movie where she was a young mother I don't see her acting in a whole lot of things through I like Sci-Fi but find its been the destination Genra for bad movie makers on a budget historically anyway With obvious exceptions I love sci-fi I like it but there is a lot of bad Sci-Fi. Correct What do you think of the new Star Wars? I'm suprised this movie got such a high rating on Rotten Tomatoes I thought the new Star Wars film was OK Yeah, most of my favorite movies bomb on rotten, Like The Big Lebowski. That's surprising, it's a fantastic film You bet it is Dude. Ive written this movie title down will watch it. Do you like the Matrix? Inception has a similar vibe. I actually prefer Inception I really liked the first one. I didn't know there was a second... just seemed like they couldnt deliver what was promised in the series there was three
ough one . listening to steely dan recently .
Was there German submarines in it too? I love some U-Boat action as well. No, but air combat is shown from start to end better watch than get the clue. lol filming began in May 2016 and ended in sept. WOW!!!

HARRY STYLES ACTUALLY WON THIS ROLE AND THEY DIDN'T EVEN KNOW HE WAS A SINGER Tommy was the sole survivor of a German Ambush in the movie He made it to the beach and found thousands of soldiers waiting to be rescued THEY MOVIE DID VERY WELL IN USING LAND SEA AND AIR THROUGHOUT THIS FILM tHE PART WHERE THEY FIND A GERMAN DIVE BOMB ATTACK SOUNDS INTERESTING AS WELL When one of the boats starts taking on water due to gunshots, Alex accuses Gibson of being a spy and demanded that he leave. THEY LEAVE THAT NIGHT ON THE DESTROYER Gibson had actually stolen his identity from a solider he had burried. Gibson ultimately ended up drowning, unfortunately
hat is my future plan what else do you enjoy ?
Yes, the credit should go to the director. It came out  back in 2009. the story plot doesnt seems filled with actions it is a scientific movie but has alot of drama what is the role of LIMBO what is means subconcious world,where there is  a risk of  forgetting  everything it is a unique concept which force people to watch the movie and see what will happen next are u there? are people drawn into dreams in the movie the critical responses are mixed views of good and bad are u there,shall we abort the discussion
it STAYS it moves in it pays rent for a week I feel like this movie is totally like cendrillon it was weird for me, as a male the women were almost too attractive, too womanly in a way I guess it was just good animation yes it is very special and personnally it wasn't something that really like I liked Beauty and the Beast better a lot better it wasn't make with the typical female that we can see now true for me it is a story that we see on every animated movie what is? the love story? a girl have a problem or somehting like that and after that she meet a man who can save her Cinderella Syndrome is a huge problem For guys, it's White Knight syndrome so it goes both ways men looking for a woman to save, as well totally and i feel like children should see other things because it not real life indeed for me at the end, it
went fishin with my buddies ! www , i wish i could ! i am allergic to seafood seafood or worms ? lol ! . both ! is that your favorite food ? i prefer venison actually ! what is that ? i love cheese , especially goat cheese ! ver had that before

It has more than 90% on Rotten Tomatoes and a CinemaScore of A+, so lots of other people must have liked it too! Yes, I have. I watched it 3 times. It was very interesting getting to know more about Alan Turing and his life . It was very compelling . Yeah, very interesting character. His work on intelligence codes during WWII might have saved Britain. That is correct, he was very brave . The definition of a real solider. Some people say that the movie takes too much artistic license - that it isn't true to life, but I don't know about that. I'm not sure about that as well, all I know is that it's a superb movie. It should've won an Oscar Yeah! Definitely for acting. Keira Knightly was very good as well as Cumberbatch. Yes, she's a great actress . I feel like her role played a huge part in the success of the  film. When Turing's almost-boyfriend died I was so sad. He never was a really happy guy. Things were different back then.
i shop pretty much at bargain deals . oh , cool ! i like donna karen ! o not really . i take my moped around town

i there . how are you ?
It is gory especially for a big film like that.  No.  Punching will not work.  LOL. It was nice speaking to you today.
It must have been spectacular on a big screen yes, it does but I usually don't look at that so as not to disappoint myself-because movies are typically merely a depiction of a book, such as in this case How to you find the first part ? The psychiatric hospital seems unnecessary. it definitely hit the point as far as showing these wealthy and snobby people who only care about wealth and nothing beyond... It does seem unnecessary, the main story is about Gatsby and Daisy It seems more focused on Nick. But overall this seems like a good movie to see, I'll definitely look to download it online this weekend the movie is not that old either-2013
i work alot of hours so i can relate . yeah , work was offering overtime , so i stayed for 13 hours today what do you do for fun ? i listen to a lot of classical music i am not into classical much , i love imagine dragons . reat band . always listened to them in my younger years . was a wild child yea , where did you grow up ? florida . pretty flat here , but i stay because my grandchildren live here . i grew up in texas , sadly hurricanes for both of us . ours will be worse . the pharmacy will be closed tomorrow , three day weekend . yay ! is that where you work ?

Everyone remember the movie as the one where Tom Hanks and Leo DiCaprio plays together Whats the movie about again? Leo is a con-man, dublicating checks and Tom Hanks is the detective who is trying to catch him Are you sure you watched it. If not I strongly recommend it. Wow, that sounds fun. What time period does it take place in. I meant to say "I have not watched it" Ohhh, ok, then definitely watch it. It definitely sounds like something I would be interested in. Spielberg, Hanks and DiCaprio. Can't go wrong with that. right. Let me tell you more about the movie but not spoilers Absoulutely Leo is a very smart young guy who is just forging checks. He stole more than 2.8 million dollars from an airline company before even they realized Tom Hanks, the FBI guy became obsessed about this guy, and made a real effort to catch him This is why the movie is called, catch me if you can Wow, this movie sounds like a good one! It is based on a true story by the way At the ending credits, they tell us what happened to the characters in real life A true story? Wow It definitely sounds like something I'd like to check out. do you want to learn anything else about the movie Sure then ask :) Do you know what time period it takes place in? the story begins at 1963 Ok thanks the times when it was easier to forge checks
mostly asian food and some mexican , and you ? i love american , mexican , asian and italian food . my hobby is gardening , i love flowers , do you like it ? i have an admiration for gardening and flowers too . my family is all tall .
Chris Pine plays Steve Trevor an american pilot and love interest of Wonder Woman. Danny Huston plays General Erich Ludendorff. Robin Wright plays Antiope. Gal Gadot plays Wonder Woman. I really like Chris Pine and Gal Gadot. How long is the movie? The document doesn't say, but i'm sure you can find the answer on a search engine. Wanna know the director's name? Awesome. I'll be sure to look that up. Yes, I'd love to know the director's name. Her name is Patty Jenkins, she is the first female director of a live-action, theatrically released comic book superhero film. Wanna know what era the setting takes place? She seems like a bad ass. Yes please tell me what era this movie takes place in! World War 1. Wanna know what prompts her to recall her past? Cool! Yes I do! In present day Paris, Diana receives a photographic plate of herself and four men taken during World War 1, prompting her to recall her past. Wanna know who she is the daughter of ? Who is she the daughter of? Daughter of Queen Hippolyta. Wanna know what island she was raised on? Sure where was she raised? On an island called Themyscira. Wanna know who trained Wonder Woman to become the force she is today? Yes! This movie sounds very interesting,  Does she fight in World War 1 too? Yes she does. Do you want to know how she meets her love interest? Yes I'd love to know that! She gets trained by Antiope. She meets her love interest when she is young and when rescuing American pilot captain, Steve Trevor when he his plane crashes off the Themysciran coast. Do you want to know who sacrifices their self to save wonder woman? who sacrifices themselves for her? Antiope. Do you want to know what special weapons Wonder Woman has? Oh wow. Yes what weapons does she have?
it is all about my whole look .
Well I have one gem of an action flick for you now. Enter "John Wick," the classic 2014 action thriller. It stars Keeanu Reeves Oh. Sounds interesting. What's it about? So basically John Wick is a retired hitman and his vintage car (which was a gift from his recently deceased wife) was stolen and his puppy was killed so obviously he is out for revenge on the perpetrator Cool! Sounds like one of those "on the edge of your seat" type of movies. Are there any more actors or actresses in the movie that I would know? Well I think there's a bunch of B-list actors like Michael Nyqvist, Alfie Allen, Adrianne Palicki, so if you're into that then yeah there's quite a few. Keanu is obviously the most well know. Basically you go for John Wick Gotcha. So, does the movie plot take place in the US? Or elsewhere? Yeah so it'll take place in New York since the main "baddie" in the story revolves around the Russian crime syndicate in NYC Nice. Well, definitely sounds like a movie I would be interested in seeing! If and when you watch the movie look out for some crazy, "knock your socks off" action sequences with a decent amount of humor thrown in Perfect! Sounds like my kind of movie! If you're a follower of rottentomatoes, it received a decent critic score of 86% Wow, that's a high score! It must be a great movie. Can't wait to see it How do we finish the conversation? I think we have to have 12 responses each haha so I guess I'll go on So also there's a moment of the film where we learn about the previous assassinations that John made which is sure to turn heads If you're a fan of Chad Staheleski films then this one will be good for you as well Oh, I love Chad Staheleski. Does he play a main role? Haha I bet. If you're talking about Chad, I don't think so but the acting is so good from the previously mentioned actors that I don't think you'll be missing too much
o reason . the worst thing i do is eat junk between meals hat is funny do you like to travel yes i go all the time . with my family ice i like to take my family scuba diving every year hat is very nice of you . what do you look like ?
Didn't they make a sequel to bruce almighty? do you happen to know why the Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic scores would be so low? They're 48 percent and 46/100 respectively wow no i wouldn't i remember all the good critique from the 90s about it i don't know why they would give such a low rating Evan Baxter is the rival who gets the promotion that causes the breaking point for Jim Carrey's character in the movie Ah yea that's steve carrell huh? yes it's Steve Carrell whom I also love...don't know which one I like more between him and Jim Carrey what do you think about Bruce's use of God-like powers in the movie? exactly the type of things i'd be doing lol. Jim and steve both did really well bringing out the main characters personality they both are those kind of slapstick comiedians one of the reviews actually said "Carrey is hilarious in the slapstick scenes" haha that's awesome. Who directed? some of the funny use of powers were when he causes Evan to embarrass himself on the air which gets him fired though haha yep
do not tell my students , but i sing karaoke on friday nights !
It looks like it is set in the 50' 's I wonder if they only used positive reviews though. That is a good point.Shall we say bye?
i only have 26 kids thank the lord what subjects do you teach ? just general stuff . i am a new teacher
I agree I love a good story I liked how they actually built up the characters He really did look different, my MIL didn't recognize him until the end when the credits played haha. The coolest thing, to me, is that Mike actually got to the NFL despite all that. You have to smile a bit The other thing I was surprised about is  Tim didn't sing. You would have thought he would have launched into some sort of song It was just such a "positive" movie. I wish there were more movies out there like it. Especially now when we really need it. Yes!!! Despite everything that happened to him. And what he was able to overcome. I totally agree. Instead we have more movies about superheros blowing things up Sorry not a fan of those movies too much. Or movies with so much violence, and then we wonder why so many kids are becoming violent. No kidding. I guess people just dont think about it or somehow forget about that stuff. Kids however dont Scares me to no end to worry about the kids and the future Micheal being moved around in foster care, and then having a mother like Leigh Ann take him in is so encouraging. I'd love to get involved in foster care. I have always thought htat would be an amazing gift to give someone The stability of a home and a famil like that would be amazing

oh 100% it's the most memorable part of the film easily
Yes, I enjoyed it.  I thought it explored Batman's side as a human, not just a superhero.  It did a nice job of portraying the psychological issues he had as a person.  Christian Bale is a good actor in it Sounds like a good one. I'm debating whether or not to see it. I'm still not too smart with these types of movies. Would this be a Marvel or DC film and if I may ask, what's the difference? This one is a DC movie.  It's directed by Christopher Nolan It also has Liam Neeson, Gary Oldman, and Michael Caine in it Do you usually follow movie ratings when you watch something new? Oh yes, Liam Neeson. I know him, hes a good actor. Ive seen him in the Taken Series. Great character he plays and now recently in another suspense movie that takes place aboard a train. However the other actors, I haven't heard of them. I typically follow movie ratings when I go to the theater but not if I'm watching anything at home.

Oh cool! I haven't seen that one. What can you tell me about it? It's a pixar animation from 2013 that was the prequel to the movie Monsters Inc. from 2001. The plot is of two monsters, Mike and Sulley during their time at University. They start off as enemies but slowly become friends through rivals. That sounds very interesting! Do you know who voices the characters of Mike and Sully? Billy Crystal is the voice of Mike and John Goodman is the character Sulley! Noah Johnston also voices as young Mike! They are all three great actors! I especially like Billy and John! Do you know who directed the movie? The movie was directed by Dan Scanion!

Do you know what it means to "get bogged down in treacle"? I don't know what to make of that review I have no idea what that word means, but I'm assuming they are trying to say the movie lacked in substance or Carrey's acting ability? It seems the second review doesn't think Jim is a real actor "...Carrey probably nursed hopes of one day becoming a real actor" Both reviews don't seem to like his acting skills.... I'd still see it given the cast. Never heard of the director though Hello?

Here's one of the key scenes: During a gig at a restaurant, Sebastian slips into a passionate jazz improvisation despite warningsfrom the owner to stick to the setlist of traditional Christmas songs. Mia overhears the music asshe passes by ("Mia and Sebastian's Theme"). Moved, she enters the restaurant, but Sebastian isfired for his disobedience. As he storms out, Mia attempts to compliment him, but he brushes heroff.Months later, Mia runs into Sebastian at a party where he plays in a 1980s pop cover band; sheteases him by requesting "I Ran (So Far Away)", a song he considers an insult for "a seriousmusician". After the gig, the two walk to their cars, lamenting each other's company despite thechemistry between them ("A Lovely Night"). I haven't seen the movie either The sounds good is the movie still in theaters? No it was from 2016 Here's the next key scene: After more failed auditions, Mia decides, at Sebastian's suggestion, to write a one-womanplay. Sebastian begins to perform regularly at a jazz club ("Summer Montage"), and the twomove in together. Sebastian's former classmate Keith invites him to be the keyboardist in hisjazz fusion band, where he will be offered a steady income. Although he is dismayed by theband's pop style, Sebastian signs after overhearing Mia trying to convince her mother thatSebastian is working on his career. The band finds success, but when Mia attends one oftheir concerts ("Start a Fire") she is disturbed, knowing Sebastian does not enjoy theirmusic. I'm not a big fan of musicals but I do like the leading actors Yeah the actors are good. What songs are in the movie?
yeah i get to help people find their style .
I think it's because of her time with Stefan She understands humans. I think during the time she fell for Stefan changed her views True, stefan has a lot of influence on her...otherwise she wouldn't of turned the moors into a dark kingdom Reading the whole key note, it was because Stefan betrayed her by ripping off her wings. But despite that, she still has a soft heart for humans

Hello, you should watch the Post. It's a thriller starring Meryl Streep. Really?, tell me more. What's the plot? It's about the Washington Post and the decision to publish the Pentagon Papers. It really does a good job of showing how decisions which look right through the lens of history were really hard to make in the moment. Oh, really?, sounds fascinating. Who directed it? It was directed by Stephen Spielberg. It has Tom Hanks, sarah Paulson, and Bob Odenkirk in it as well. Oh, that sounds great, who did the score for the movie? I'm not sure about that, but it does have an 88 percent score on Rotten Tomatoes and an "A" from Cinemascore. That looks great. Do you agree with that rating? I liked when Meryl Streep, as Katharine Graham, made the call to publish the papers. It was riveting. Do you like to watch historical dramas?

The Imitation Game is a 2014 American historical drama film directed by Morten Tyldum andwritten by Graham Moore, loosely based on the biography Alan Turing: The Enigma by AndrewHodges (which was previously adapted as the stage play and BBC drama Breaking the Code). Itstars Benedict Cumberbatch as real-life British cryptanalyst Alan Turing, who decrypted Germanintelligence codes for the British government during the Second World War.

Mike works really hard and Sulley was a privileged monster growing up. It has Billy Crystal and John Goodman as the two main characters.

Have you seen the movie The Shape of the Water? No, not yet, but I am planning on it.  How about you? I've kinda been waiting to read the book first.  I am on the library waiting list. Yes, it's really good. Guillermo Del Toro at his finest. Yep, I have read the reviews on Rotten Tomatoes.
well i don't know much about voice cast, so i will pass what do you find most interesting about this article in regards to the movie? I just like animation movies sometimes and this falls into the category Same here I really like that this movie is an american 3D computer- animated musical fantasy film. The ratings on rotten tomatoes was pretty good. Moreover I seem to have good history with adventure movies yeah real good from rotten tomatoes have you heard of "cryokinetic" before now? Im sure this movie will become a musical broadway . no I have not

It seems even the critics think so as it got an A+ score from CinemaScore.  I wouldn't call 2013 'recent' unless you are also into really old movies.  They casted Kristen Bell as Anna, though I really liked how Jonathan Groff played Kristoff. Oh haha, Frozen? I didn't realize it was Disney's 53rd feature film.  Glad they based it off a good author like Hans Christian Anderson.  A good story to start with makes for a good movie. Yup. I've seen a bit of it, I never decided to watch it in its entirety. Wow, 53 feature films! I know, right?!  Wondering when it will become a musical on broadway.  Not that I am one to go see them, but it seems to be the progress of things. I always wondered how different it would have turned out if they had not erased Anna's memories.  Poor Elsa, living with all that guilt. Haha I wonder too, that would be nice. Like you said earlier it is popular with kids. I'm more of an old-school Disney fan. I think the last Disney movies I've actively watched and thoroughly enjoyed were Toy Story and Monsters inc. but I'll still watch things like Fox and the Found and want to cry like a baby haha Elsa erased Anna's memories? Hound* How does she do that? If it wasn't for my kids, I wouldn't have seen this either.  They were actually too young when it came out, weren't really into watching movies.  Then a friend showed them the movie and I didn't hear anything else for days afterwards.  Could have used some of those memory erasing skills the trolls had.  The trolls erased Anna's memories of her sister's magical abilities in order to save her life. The trolls warned her not to use her magic or it might trigger Anna's memories to come back, thereby undoing what was done to keep her from freezing.  So, instead of mastering her snow/cold skills, Elsa hid them.  She came to see them as something horrible and wrong.

I think the movie haws enough adult references to make it good comedy watch
I like that myself I loved all the action in this movie the action was excellent the U-boat was realistic Yes it was I loved when the ship blew up and how close they were to being killed it was great acting and special effects Yes agree. What did you think about how there was a lot of talking through out the movie? Wasn’t a lot of talking. I like that a great deal I did too. It made it feel more intense for me. the movie got good reviews too Yes it did. Did you feel a lack of drama from it?
y dad taught me to respect the military
oh . ok . i do not really like veggies , love my sweets ! i use too lol i love going fishing
i love brightening their day .
y life is the average one what do you do for a living ?
They have captured an alien creature and are keeping it there to study.  Do you want to know the name of the movie? yes please It is The Shape of Water.  It attracted a lot of positive attention for the good critic ratings and reviews. What did you like about it? The story of how she falls in love with the creature and how she begins secretly visiting him.  She only communicates through sign language. oh wow, that does sound really interesting! Sally Field plays the cleaning lady.  There is a Russian spy working at the lab, spying on the work the lab is doing with the creature. I love Sally Field, I think she is a great actress The creature was discovered in South America. It is half amphibian half human. Did it seem to possess a lot of human qualities? Yes.  ally Field takes the creature to her home, and keeps it alive in the bathtub. *Sally Does she have to try to hide it from the authorities?  That sounds like a really intriguing plot. Yes!  The man who discovered it is in charge of the research project and he is looking diligently for it. One of Sally Field's neighbors discovers the creature eating one of his cats. I bet that would definitely cause some issues! The creature slashes at his arm and runs away.  Sally Field finds him and takes him back to her apartment.  He touches the neighbors arms where he slashed it and it heals by the next morning. Oh so the creature has some kind of other-wordly powers?
ice , what kind of food do you like to eat ? regular i suppose . what do you eat ? i really enjoy eating sushi .
Hi friend! Have you seen the movie, Catch me if you can? Hi how are you friend?  I’m just finishing watching a great movie! I have!  Just saw it, how about you?
oh , i can relate , in a way . my wife stays home with kids .
ot realy i just do a lot with my family i am babysitting this week . y mother and i are close , father not so much . why not ? i want to party soon when i party i party ! ot being employed has him going crazy . no family of my own so no worries . oh i gotcha , we help each other in mine it is a must . hat is really nice . i want that some day . yea that is how we were taught to be
exactly why I use that site! I didn't know the film was based on a non-fiction self help book, that's interesting. The best movie rating site by far. Wow, I also didn't realize that the screenwriter was Tina Fey. Tina Fey is behind some of the best movies out ever! I never knew about her either. Kind of cool that it got listed in the top 50 Greatest Teen Comedies on Rotten Tomatoes. I wonder what it was ranked on the list. I think there is nothing close this day and age compared to Mean Girls Looking back we had no idea this movie was going to be iconic. I like it when you can recognize who did the film, just based on watching it. It's a typical Mark Waters movie. He did get a A+ for Cinema I'm sure many teenagers can relate to the film, even though it might be a bit over the top. yes this movie is still relate able even to today. It's the type of thing that never gets aged, because everyday in a school somewhere, the same basic themes exist. cliques are reality always. every year that goes by it seems this movie moves up higher and higher on the best movie list I wonder if they will ever remake this film, and who they'd cast for Lindsey Lohan's part? they just dont make movies like this anymore Could you imagine a Mean Girls 2?!?! It's funny how in the movie they are so ruthless. The burn book and fake libel stuff. i wonder how many burn books were created because of this movie Exactly, a teenage girl watching this movie, takes notes and brings it to reality in their own school to some degree. now they use weapons instead of name calling Well, I don't know. I don't think I can recall a female using weapons in school. It's mostly guys. the burn book could be called twitter now lol true to that mostly punk boys
Not really, I mean, it seems like they are pulling it apart a little too much and forgot to watch it from an entertaining angle. What do you think? I agree with you. To be honest, I rarely agree with critics. Do you consider the opinions of critics when deciding to watch a film? I really don't. Sometimes, I'll check in to see what people think, but usually I avoid critics so I can watch the movie fresh without anybody's opinions in my head. Did you like the slapstick humor in this movie? I do, but I think I have fond memories of it from when I was a kid. I'm not sure how I would feel reacting as an adult watching it for the first time. Did you watch it as a kid? Totally. I did watch it as a kid. I think the slapstick works better here because Kevin talks to the camera. I thoroughly related to him with his older brother, reminded me of my own brother! I loved Catherine O'Hara in this too! Oh yeah! I think the technique of breaking the fourth wall works. It reminds me a bit of Ferris Bueller's Day Off in that respect. I don't think you see that as much in films these days.

That's a good one too. not much but when a film depicts what happened back in history, i watch them i kind of like exploring things, even if that's history :) So more of a fan of the historical than the political. do you know if the watergate scandal related to this at all? I don't think so. But kind of the same time, more or less, isn't it? this was kind  of included in the document...so confused yeap durind Nixon's presidency do you agree to all the critical responses on this film? They are kinda of divided. The critics, I mean. yeap... what does it take to be a critic? Interested in becoming one?
Yeah, she's the girl Cady (Lohan) makes friends with who isn't a Plastic I recall thinking both Tina Fey and Tim Meadows were a bit miscast, did you agree? No, I think they fit their roles well.
you are a crimson tide fan ?
i like to tell jokes but i am not very good
hat would be fun lets do it
hat is cool , i love music and going to shows his chat is slow today , what kind of music do you like ?
Yeah, do you still remember parts of this movie? Of course, I watched it more than a couple of times actually lol. Hahaha, me too, it is just the most grounded movie in the MCU. I feel like everything was simple and that made it so great since it was unassuming I know right, I also am a fan of the Director. John Favreau. Yeah, he plays the part as Happy. I also knew him from the movie The Replacements. I have heard of that movie, and wow that is interesting lol. Yeah, I loved the scene in this movie where Tony Stark did not show up in the awarding ceremony or like an event honoring his company. It tells you who Tony Stark initially. Yes, it opened up in the very first parts of the movie, you get to know the playboy arrogant type of person Tony Stark really is, and Robert Downey Jr is and should only be the Iron Man in our generation, no one else. haha Exactly, I dont see anyone other than him playing the role of Tony Stark AND Iron Man. He is just like in the comics, his height is a bit lacking but only an inch maybe but thats very minuscule of a criticism. Hahaha, yes, still the suit makes him taller. Yeah, he becomes a 6 footer inside the suit, I remember reading about it. The rating of the movie is perfect though. Definitely, an almost 8 average is perfect for the movie, 8 rating is already a compelling movie for me but not taking anything away from the movie because I loved this movie. Very true. And by the way, Obadiah Stane was such a great nemesis for the movie, or villain. I agree so, I feel like he is the most impactful and most appealing villain in the MCU. Next to Loki. Yes, even if he did not have any powers, Jeff Bridges was amazing playing the role. Us talking about this movie makes me want to watch it again, haha.
I dont recall him trying to take over... Why did he? So Tony Stark inherits the company from his father. Early in the movie, he is in war-torn Afghanistan with James Rhodes to demonstrate his new "Jericho" missile. After the demonstration, his convoy is ambushed and he is taken and imprisoned. He befriends a fellow prisoner, Yinsen. The terrorist group, Ten Rings, who imprisoned him, wanted Stark and Yinsen to create a Jericho missile for them. Do you know the movie this well? First, to save Tony, Yinsen implants an electromagnet into Stark's chest to keep the shrapnel shards that wounded him from reaching his heart and killing him. Yes, very well! I love this movie. Sweet I remember parts of it, but not that well! I would absolutely watch it again though

I didn't see the movie so I can't agree or disagree with them, but it looks like most critics thought it was a bad movie. I wish we knew how much money the movie either made or lost. Sometimes, movie companies are not trying to make a GREAT movie. They are just trying to make money. That would be nice information to have for sure, the second critic even agrees that this movie was more intended to print money than to be a great film
It also had mr. and mrs. potato head it is such a cute movie I think they made like 3 or 4 of them Who was Mr potato head? Woody was Andy (the human kids) favorite toy. Then one day his mom gets him a new Buzz toy. Andy no longer really plays with Woody. Great story Woody tries to get rid of Buzz. sounds like a great story Andy is moving and Woody throughs Buzz out the window. Andy doesn't notice until it is too late. Woody and his friends wind up feeling really bad and try to go back to save Buzz Who are some of the other voices?
Hi! Have you ever seen the movie The Great Gatsby I wonder if Gatsby ever what he wanted

Only the Mayor, he is seen to disregard the safety warnings of the chief because he wants to continue making money for the town.
because my dad worried about income . i just want to move out . i use to drink alot , so bad i had to get help . do not be that guy .
Well its sounds like a good movie to see as long as you are able to pay attention to it and not be in a room full of kids or something I agree. You should definitely watch it without kids it's a complicated movie...I guess the guy's mind that they sedated was set up to protect against intruders in his dreams and it backfires and DiCaprio starts to die in the dream Will have to see if it on Netflix or something SO they do have blocks in place I guess so
Yeah haha you'd think people who aren't into that kind of thing wouldn't bother watching at all right? I mean I guess there are like really cool art films and new wave and stuff but when it comes to block buster movies, it's not like there are a ton of super amazing romances- this one definitely is one of the best even if a little cheesy. I think that people love to hate these movies They're the nickelback of films
do you have a niece or nephew ? i just have a koi fish i have both ! i wish i had a fish . is your fish big ?

The only hero I have never heard of is Hawkeye He is one of the lesser known ones and does not play a particular huge role in this movie. Must be why I do not know him. Im surprised to notice it came out 6 years ago It definitely feels like it was just last year. Time sure does fly. Joss Wheldon did a really good job at directing this film. Do you know if he directs other Marvel movies? He has written many TV shows but I do not think he has done any other movies. Would you say it is pretty accurate to the other movies and comics, since it combines heros Yes definitely. It does a good job of bringing all of the characters together into one movie. Thats good. I hate when crossovers do not stay to true to the originals I think Marvel does a good job overall with all of their productions. I know they have been fairly accurate in the movies I have seen before. Do you think there will be more avengers movies? I think in the future there will be interest again and there will be more movies. So what is the villain in the movie? Loki, who is actually Thor's brother. He wants to subjugate Earth Seems like a good way to create a conflict in the movie. Adding in brothers to fight makes it more interesting
lots of cook books . i am a vegetarian hat makes sense . how long have you been one ?

i am doing well . tell me about yourself .
This looks like an OK movie. I agree, I think it would be a decent superhero movie. What makes you think it will be OK? The Rotten Tomatoes score is 92% but the Metacritic score is only 69/100. Do you like the cast? I like most of the cast, especially Chris Evans. Who is your favorite Avenger? I would have to say Iron Man based on the Critical Responses. Who is yours? I would choose the Hulk--I like the description of Banner's "wry reservoir of calm ready to become a volcano" That is very cool. Do you like most superhero movies? No, I really don't like them. Do you agree with the ratings of this movie? I would have to see the Metacritic scores in depth, but based on the Critical Responses that Metacritic score seems low. Do you like the key scene? It's not my favorite scene, and I wish Nick Fury could have stopped Loki from taking the Tessaract. What do you think? I think the wormhole was key to the whole movie.
Wonder Woman. You seen it? Nope, I haven't Does it have good ratings? It’s action packed. Gal Gadot is great as a strong protagonist Cool. What other characters are there? Sure does 92% on rotten tomatoes Wow that's pretty high Chris pine from Star Trek is Steve Trevor. A US pilot that meets Wonder Woman after he crash lands in a strange and amazing place I see Are there other superheroes in this movie? It’s part of the DC movie universe as a follow up to Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice Oh cool, cool. What time period does the movie take place in? No other super heroes but she’s all the movie needs anyway. Great direction by Patty Jenkins It’s a period piece set during WWI. A lot of fun costumes and set pieces too Ah I see Does Wonder Woman get involved in the war? in a way she does. She’s a goddess who seeks vengeance from the god of war and since this is a World War epic, there will be some meddling in others affairs So there's some mythology involved in this movie? It has a cinema score of A and it’s definitely worth watching if you like action adventure light comedy and drama That's a good rating Light comedy is nice

It came out in 2014. It's strange that I have not heard about it much. That's true. I guess it didn't get the press it deserved. it did not get a bad score on Rotten Tomatoes REally? Do you know the score it got? Yeah, it said it was 8 out of 10 Odd. But then again, we can catch it on Cable or Netflix Maybe. It's an action movie and that is my favorite genre Me too! I love action movies Does the story seem interesting to you? I think so . Maybe I'll check out Netflix and see if its available. I do not know the director Chad Stahelski, or David Leitch I think I heard of Leitch. Supposed to be pretty good. The Viggo character looks interesting Yeah, I agree with that. Should be a good movie Yeah, it had an 86% average on rotten tomatoes Thats pretty high. It has to be an exciting movie. Surprised it just disappeared The metacritic score was 68/100 which is not good Ah ha! That explains it. Must be more users of metacritic than rotten tomatos. Unfair that one site can destroy a good movie It seems like there were mixed reactions Arent there always mixed reactions? Seems like we all like different things.

ok . it is a nice day here . how about by you ?
what is your favorite genre ?
No, sir .So what can you tell me about the movie itself? the beginning is about a man getting a job as a stock broker, and he gets into drugs and sex because thats what his boss told him to do while working Well actually I remeber seeing it a long time ago. thank you for the info yea he eventually quits hi job and starts his own company while at the company he hires some people and they start scamming people for there money Ok. I like that Jordan Played by Leonardo DiCaprio befriends his neighbor, and they both found their own companies yea they both were successful at scamming Yes, indeed.\
That opening with the Tesseract escape was pretty cool, setting the tone for the movie. MAY BE That was the reason for the film's success Yeah, it was pretty surprising when Hawkey got enslaved so early in the movie though. It refers to  image capture skills PLEASE CHAT ME FAST I'm not sure about that, but Nick Fury is always so cool. Too bad the bad guys always have to get one up on them. It's their nature and it's impossible I guess so. I wonder what the deal is with the leader of those Chitauri? Very mysterious. It was a mystery to the last For this film at least I guess. It was pretty sad when Coulson died. Did that scene get you? There is a glimpse of seeing Yeah, at least it brought the Avengers together finally, no need for them to be fighting each other the whole time.
Yeah, Rotten Tomatoes gave it a 92%, Metacritic gave it a 87% and CinemaScore gave it a A That is a really good mix of reviews. The plot seems to be very unique and interesting too. All around it sounds enticing. Yeah, Sally Hawkins in the lead role is great. She plays a mute cleaner who works at this secret government lab who falls in love with this top secret amphibian creature. It also sets the stage well with orphaned child scene. It leaves a lot to the imagination and lets you really connect with the character. Yes, they are able to connect really well because she's mute and he's a creature so they commute in a different way. *communicate
i live in chicago . i am a bar owner . are you married ? my favorite bar is called blue . i go there with my athlete group re you married ? i have been married a few times . 5 to be exact . o , too busty exploring my options . pros of being an athlete ll me 2 interesting things about you . blue is my favorite color , and i would love to be an explorer ! i am a pipe smoker and in 3rd grade was the winner of my spelling bee .
i like both ! i am excited to retire like you , my only freetime is on weekends . i was like that until i retired , now i can even sleep late
Would you like to talk about Mean Girls? Sure. I thought Lindsay Lohan was good in the movie. What about you? Yes Lindsay Lohan really played her role well to show how social cliques are bad in society. This movie was highly praised by critics. Do you usually like to see movies with high ratings? Yeah, I remember the Rolling Stones called it comic gold. I love high ratings for a movie, but there are some good ones with low ratings. Even this movie has Metacritic score of 66/100 but I think it should be higher. What else did you like about it? I enjoyed that it dealt with the serious topic of female high school cliques through comedy. I thought Tina Fey adapted Rosalind Wiseman's book "Queen Bees and Wannabes" well into a film. Do you generally like comedies? The social cliques damage girls and that is why it was referred to as a "knockout." It even made  one of the top 50 greatest teen comedies Comedies are great, especially this one. The reference to the clique girls as Plastics makes me laugh Did you know it got a cinema score of A-? Haha yeah, hearing Jan and Damian describe the Plastics to Cady was great. Wow, that's a good score. It seems like CinemaScore appreciated having the great team of Lindsay Lohan, Tina Fey, and Mark Waters together. When Cady joins the Plastics, Janis plots revenge because she is excluded and uses Cady as ammo. Who else is your favorite character? I liked Janis because she started plotting against the Plastics and welcomed Cady when she arrived. Regina is interesting too because she's the most popular. Why do you think the Plastics invited Cady to sit with them at lunch? Rachel McAdams as Regina George complemented the role played by Lindsay Lohan, Cady because she plays queen bee real well. I think she invited Cady to sit with them to smell the roses and see if Cady was Plastics material, outside appearance having already qualified. What is another scene you like?
HELLO Do you like movie with Angelina Jolie I'm a big fan for sure

hello! The actor for Anna is Kristen Bell That is correct! And Indina Mendel plays Elsa That is also correct! I really like that Walt Disney was inspired by the previous fairy tale the snow queen Did you know that Frozen is the best animated musical to come out of disney according to critics I did not know that It's impressive that Eva Bella plays an 8 year old Elsa I really enjoy that the fearless princess sets off to find her sister I know!

The story begins in 1987, where he quickly learn the job of stockbroker but he is sack because of Black Monday. ok It is not for families, it as a lot of sex and drugs. oh ok and immoral behaviour oh yes that doesnt sound like a family movie The second part of the film is where Belfort starts his own firm and has a lot of success by being dishonest oh it sounds intense what happens next It gets more intense as Belfort slides into a decadence because of all the money he makes wall street is tricky like that sounds like he has become greedy as well sounds like a good movie so far then what happens He divorce his wife then marries another woman Noami played by Margot Robbie He use his wife family to funnel money to Switzerland to evade the FBI how exciting margot robbie is a good actress too then what happens But he gets caught by the FBI and became an informant, Then the film is a cat and mouse game, Belfort tires to frame his friends.

hey there, what movie did you see? The movie is Despicable Me What is it about? It's a 3D computer-animated movie about a supervillan It has funny punch lines and is a movie that both kids and adults like The cast includes Steve Carell, Jason Segel and Russel Brand

It is! I have seen it too and I love it. it is somehow weird that its genre is black comedy I did not know that I did not know that either, thats an interesting fact though I love the role of DiCaprio I love him in his every movie he was also the producer of this movie though He is a great actor, I didnt know he was the procucer as well I learnt "penny stocks" by the help of this movie people can easily be manipulated by those Yeah I imagine the movie required a lot of preparation before acting it, so what was your favorite scene? I like the progress of the movie, from being a small broker, developing into a mad man Yeah, it is great to see that change. and what about the ratings the movie received? I remembered the scene "sell this pen to me" do you remember that scene Yeah I do, that scene was pretty good, the movie is a little bit underrated in rotten and metacritic but overall, all the people like the movie I guess also the yacht scene with the FBI agents I expected better ratings actually, a 75/100 and C seem to be a little low I do not trust ratings of rotten anyway they are critics i like IMDB ratings, the people's ratings I loved the scene when Jordan receives a reduced sentece for helping the FBI actually I did not like the ending
i had a chance to play b ball pro ww man i wish i could go pro highschool was football and wrestling i declined it because i like the night time yeah playing night flag football with friends is mad fun especially afterparty i know right ? usually during the day i just sleep and wake up at night i used to work overnights at the gym so daylight whats that ? rue that brother ! i am like a vampire
No, I don't believe that was one we had to read. Tell me a bit about it? So, there There’s this guy Gatsby and he’s super rich and loves to throw these big parties But he has a big secret and so on and so on. Okay, sounds intriguing. It is What's the big secret? The guy is in love with a married wonan in the ‘20s, so that was absolutely prohibited Oh, I'm sure it was a big no-no back then. It was, and is in the movie
really ? what color belt are you ? really ? what color belt you have ? cool i am a black belt , these girls have nothing on me . oops lol this is a mess , oh your a girl cool i told you i was a woman in the beginning . lol when is you nexfight i want to see it ?
It was such a great idea.  Perfect ploy. oh the theme park was funny I loved seeing Gru really develop love for the girls over time. It was very adorable and heart warming. you just knew the girls were going to interrupt the meeting their kids I loved the scene when Gru has to rescue the girls. oh yeah i agree And the moon getting bigger in Vector's ship was hilarious. I also loved all of the interactions between Dr. Nefario and any other character. They were hilarious. Russell Brand really was the perfect choice for him.

Oh I haven't seen Frozen. Maleficent is considered a Superhero Genre Oh really, that is kind of weird. I would have thought it was more of a Fantasy. It would make more sense! It is from Disney! Still for it's limits, it is improbably fun to watch, due to it's characters. My favorite character is probably Angelina Jolie's because she is a great actress! Well, she meets and falls in love with a boy named Stefan. And they grow apart. She is the protector of the Moors forest.
never WHen did it come out? Who stars in it? its got lindsay lohan in it rachel mcadams amanda Seyfried it came out in 2004 Is it a long movie? eh, not really average lenght i think about an hour and a half Its about teen drama, but its pretty funny a comedy then? good Maybe I will watch it Did you watch the movie more than once?

its a cult who are we trying to fool
Her past? I think she has a great origin story! I loved that they showed her growing up in Themyscira and how she became Wonder Woman! What was your favorite part? i guess the fight scenes You mean when Diana was training with Hippolyta? I thought it was fantastic to show her training and becoming stronger and how that shaped her into being the superhero she is now! yes it was really great I thought the scene where she rescued Steve was a great idea, as it showed a little more tenderness after all the fight training! yes i like that the war was going on in all of this it added tp the story I agree! I thought it was a great use of history to include the war and have Steve be a pilot! yes i agree I especially loved seeing Diana arm herself with the sword and the lasso, ready for battle! Such an iconic moment, I think.

maybe you are right but do not know how she would feel about my rpg computer games . just be yourself and you will have her in your possession i think you are right . i should also tell her about my weekly tabletop game session .
Yes, it shows Aurora as a baby and as she grows.  Malifient actually is watching out for Aurora as she is growing Do they form a good relationship ? Yes because in the end Malicifient saves Aurora because King Stefan was really evil and greedy. It is well worth watching, of course I watched it with my grandkids and they loved it. was the king going to hurt aurora? I can't remember exactly what it was now I have to watch it again.  Saw it a few years ago.  I That sounds interesting. how awful to hurt your own daughter though I'm not sure what he did but even in the end Malifient realize that aurora was holding the key to peace in the kingdom

I like Capt. America too but I think Iron Man is best. Did you know the movie got a 92% rating on rotten tomatoes? Yeah I like Iron Man too. I didn't know that. What do you think of Loki in the movie? I don't love Loki but that's ok. I like Captain America, Iron Man and the Hulk more than Loki. This has been a good conversation! The felt the way that they plotted how Loki came to Earth from the outer world could've been done better. Yeah, I feel that. but I don't have any ideas in mind of how else it should've been done, lol I don't either haha What other Marvel movies do you recommend
he's not even included in the main cast who tf are myrtle and George? yeah they seem a little out of place i guess they needed to fill some story in a hurry

Ok sorry mine looked as though it did but its the same story. I think the description up top got longer I think maybe the top part, the key scene changed? now another key scene was added. Yes it added a second key scene.  The one where Kate realizes he is missing and tries to get a flight home
or you should go to comic cons . i go to multiple of them
I think the last critical response was interesting compared to all the other rave reviews. They all say it's "easy". The cons sound pretty funny. I love funny movies. You sure couldn't get away with some of that stuff now That's true. Yeah me too. I watch almost every film Tom Hanks does. Me too. And Leo too

Really? What's the name of his movie? The Notebook It was a summer romance type movie Ok, sounds interesting. Any intense love scenes mentioned? Do you like the genre of movies? Yeah I don't mind that genre. And you? It’s also a drama, which I don’t always enjoy. Sometimes that genre makes for sad movies. Yeah, I agree with you there. What is The Notebook about? Teenagers that fall in love and have to overcome obstacles that get in their way. Sounds like high school drama. Apparently it’s set in the 1940’s, which I didn’t know. For most teenager couples. I think it would appeal to a young crowd. Is the relationship of these teenagers interracial? Especially wit( the actors in it. Was racial segregation one of the main obstacles they had to overcome? It doesn’t mention that, at least that I see. It says that a character goes off to war. Which character? The main character perhaps? Ryan Goslings character apparently buys his love interest a house. Wow, how thoughtful. Yes, it says Noah.  That is Ryan Gosling’s character.

hello Hello have you watch the movie Which movie? catch me if can No, I haven't seen the movie. What is it about? Frank Abagnale, Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio) worked as a doctor, a lawyer, and as a co-pilot for a major airline -- all before his 18th birthday A master of deception, he was also a brilliant forger, whose skill gave him his first real claim to fame: At the age of 17, Frank Abagnale, Jr. became the most… That's crazy! All before his 18th birthday? Catch Me If You Can is a 2002 American biographical crime film directed and co-produced by Steven Spielberg from a screenplay by Jeff Nathanson. The film is based on the life of Frank Abagnale, who, before his 19th birthday, successfully performed cons worth millions of dollars by posing as a Pan American World ... yes its a action movie thrill and enjoment score 76 out of 100 Ah! So he wasn't really a doctor, layer or a co-pilot he was a con artist? 76 out of 100 is pretty good. I wonder why I hadn't heard of it since the movie was from 2002 I think it sounds pretty interesting. Can you tell me more about it? You said it's action. I wonder how the action is incorporated into the cons. I just read you said it is based on a real person! I love movies like that. I will have to look it up to watch it. yes Director: Steven Spielberg i hope u liked him Steven Spielberg has directed many successful movies. Did the movie win any Oscars? no i dont think so The story of Frank Abagnale Jr., before his 19th birthday, successfully forged millions of dollars' worth of checks while posing as a Pan Am pilot, a doctor, and legal prosecutor as a seasoned and dedicated FBI agent pursues him

In the end you dont realize how much you love your family until you experience life with out them Awesome, I always like when you can form an opinion or learn something from a film It is one of the reasons why I love cinema That is one reason why I love re-watching some of the older classics. By the way, do you know who directed the  movie? I believe it was Chris Columbus ON a side note I never really look at Rotten Tomatoes ratings I don't recall in this moment any films from him, what a bad memory do I have! Don't you consider ratings before watching a movie?
why do you say that ?
Maybe the critics like Sesame Street, as do I. Thanks for the information. Um, who is it directed by? Damien Chazelle...apparently a white man trying to "save jazz" was an appealing project to him Who wouldn't love that? What else has he directed? I do'nt know and I wasn't given that information.  I can only use the information I've been given, I'm sorry.  However you seem interested so I can tell you that there are a lot of dance numbers in this film and it seems like most important sections involve some dance number That's right up my alley. Any information on who composed the musical score?

y mom worries about me running at night since i am kinda young . hat is sweet . what do do ? i own an art gallery . for local artists like myself
I've heard about it, but I never got a chance to watch it when it was in theaters.  How accurate to the true story do you think it is? Well, one critic was noted as saying that the biographical part takes liberties with its subject.  So I would believe that it has been a little exaggerated upon to make for better cinema.  Also neither Zuckerberg nor any other Facebook staff were involved with the project.  It was however adapted from a book, so I guess that would depend on how accurate the book portrayal was to real life. That makes sense, and I wasn't sure if Zuckerberg was actually involved or not.  I can't place the actor that plays him, but I know I've heard his name.  What other movies has he been in lately? I am not sure of any other movies that Jesse Eisenberg has been in although the name does sound familiar to me as well. He looks like the guy from Zombieland, maybe that's where I've seen him.  Are there any other major actors in the movie that you know of? Yes.  Justin Timberlake is in this movie.  He is the only other name I am familiar with but this movie also stars Andrew Garfield, Armie Hammer, and Max Minghella. I never knew Justin Timberlake was in it.  Does the soundtrack have any of his music in it?
llo , how are you today ? i am good how are you i am doing wonderfully , i spoke to my moms today , they are coming to visit . it is great that you have family y one mom makes the best spaghetti and meatballs . she puts ricotta in them . does she make any fish dishes she does . my boyfriend loves her fish tacos with cilantro lime slaw . hat sounds great i love fish i do too , my other mom is allergic , so it is a rare treat . what happens when she eats it she stops breathing if we do not get to her in time . wow that is really crazy similar to those with peanut allergies . i have never experienced it
indeed . the kids are all excited to go to the movies . oh , what movie are you going to see ? ood question , the kids have not decided on which one .
Oh, that makes more sense. Pff.. well the movie sounds great.  I hope to catch it on the television or somewhere.. At the end the real bad entity, ends up killing superman, but not before they are able to defeat it.
i have cats they are pretty easy to take care of i would like a dog , if i ever retire . my clients need me re you a fan of halloween
llo , i enjoy basketball while being a doctor . hat is quite a prestigious career . i work as an engineer myself . oh really ? do you know my wife , she is a nurse ? why would i know your wife ? i heard you say things to her . our favorite place is in the mountains . hat is nice . i love to travel i have two kids , but not with my nurse wife . re they from a previous marriage ? o i bought them through adoption . i would not really say you bought them , just that you adopted them i had to pay though to adopt them , so technically i bought them . i guess that is fair to say , it just sounds wierd . ya i agree . i did get to write them off on my taxes . you would get to do that for biological children too though ya but the purchase price was written off on my taxes .
i have 4 boys an 1 daughter an 3 dogs . whose your favorite rapper ? probably biggie or nas . how about you ? it was nice to chat with someone like me ha do you like sports ? i love to play basketball with my friends
i paddle rappers for being bad . uess what ? i am on tour with frank ocean
i like football a lot
It scored high on Rotten Tomatoes and CinemaScore, so I think critiques and fans agree with your assessment. Very unusual nowadays to receive such a high rating from Rotten Tomatoes.  They are pretty tough on movies. It seems that most of the hate comes from people being upset about how well the movie started to then in on such a low note I agree.  It must have slowed down to more of a "drama" by the end. It also sounds like Frank had a natural bent for seeing loopholes in systems and used it in combination with his other skills of persuasion to con his way around the country. I didn't realize Amy Adams was also in this.  She must have been very young at the time as well.
yes yes amen . i do not like meat i learned how to do art with nice trees . i live with my pigs i hit the jack pot no body found out about . oh ! would you share with me please ? i am broke now it was not for much but i would love sharing . oh well , money is not everything cool my woman do not like that i do nothing and have nothing .
I agree. I don't know, It's also mentioned that someone killed his puppy, which was a gift from his wife. Maybe because of his past connection being a hitman Hmm... Losef stole John's car so maybe he was responsible for the killings too? Sounds like typical scene. Yeah, except that Losef is Viggo's son and John used to work for Viggo. I think they always let the goodguy live.
i like revolver the best , maybe the white album . i listen at the lab . what else do you do ? i spend time helping out at the animal shelter here . i am a chemist , like my folks were . i love it .
hat sounds fun ! my family is scattered all over the world . hen you have many places to visit .
Well, it got 96% out of 100 on Rotten Tomatoes, 95/100 Metacritic and CinemaScore B+ Oh, really? what about IMDB? I would guess, depending on who you talk to, it is either extremely factual or a pack of lies. I didn't get the IMDB score, but one critic called it the movie of the year. Does the movie improve Mark Zuckerberg's popularity overall?

Whos the main character played by? Are you still there?
I'm just glad it had a good ending. Interesting that it was set in the Cold War era It's hard to understand why quality movies like this don't do better at the box office. Also given that it was a recent release, cool to see the production from modern day film showing something of the past. I agree It's hard.. I think it's kind of an inside job. There's a lot behind scenes about movie promotion that we as civilians don't hear about. Yea, all in the promotion I guess The film industry is as corrupt as anything, haha yes, it's too bad too.

I do too. I also liked it was set during WW1. You don't see many movies in that time period. Danny Huston was really over the top, in the best way, as General Lundendorff. I agree with that. I also am a big fan of DC Comics and this is one of the entries in their extended universe. I don't know if you saw it but ever since Diana's appearance in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice I wanted to see more of her. That was pretty romantic when pilot Steve Trevor crashed offshore of the island and Diana Prince rescued him.  You certainly don't see females rescuing males very much in movies. I noticed too that the director is Patty Jenkins, which is a female.  That's kinda cool too.
i am in peace just not worried about having everything cleaned up perfectly i understand . hopefully things will smooth over . i admire it i just do not have the energy at the moment
anything you hated about it? well? Its just something I don't like about all superhero movies is the dialogue  is a little bit farfetched sometimes and they tend to have cheesy one liners during dramatic scenes yeah that is true like during the fight scenes and stuff it wont go well with 'serious movie goers' what else? Other than that I guess I would say that looking back on it maybe the effects are a little bit antiquated true, but to be fair it kind of began that whole genre in a sense i know super hero movies were there before, but marvel took it to a whole new level Yeah they have to start from somewhere i liked how light-hearted it was basically the quirkiness of it Yeah ironman is probably the most interesting of all the superheroes other than batman I know that's DC though you mean the dark knight trilogy, right? i love those! can't beat them yeah I haven't even watched the ones with george clooney and michael keaton from back in the day lol, please dont you will hate life even clooney himself apologized for that movie the keaton one was kinda OK

It wasn't what I expected but it was a great movie.  Didn't you think so? Yes, and I liked the moral of the movie. good lessons in there did you like the moral of the movie? Definitely was.  I did like the moral of the movie Disney always does such a great job I agree. I think there was a part 2 of the movie too. YEah, I believe there was I would like to see it. I remember reading The Snow Queen when I was young I do not know what the Snow Queen is.  Is it the same story line? PRetty much the same.  It was a little more scary from what I remember. You should read it It sounds interesting. I might have to give that a try. Disney does a good job of also writing in sad moments in the movie. This had some of those yes, and in a way that helps kids cope i think

Did you like this one or the sequels best? I liked this one better.
I thought the whole cast was great, Hugh Jackman really brightened everything up together though. Hugh always does that, in all the movies ... but I think the critics could be better Same, it feels like what scores the critics gave is underwhelming. I guess if you go in with high expectations you might be let down more. yes, it's true, it always happens You'd think that they would learn eventually but well ... I love movies, of this type, based on books and future alternates as well with robots they always have a good story to tell This particular story was almost like Rocky, but with robots instead It felt very inspirational near the end Exactly, that was very interesting ... Although the play made to Charlie was somewhat unfair to the and the atom fights are super cool, all the victories were epic for me Yeah, it was but it made for an epic ending And after the fight against Twin Cities I think it's great that masx will not accept to sell to Atom there was an emotional bond I felt that bond It's pretty surreal what movies can make you feel nowadays although Charlie almost in the whole movie had bad luck, then they rob him what he had won and when they started to like max and he has to deliver it, poor man I thought that was unfair, you shouldn't rob somebody because you are a sore loser. But the biggest and most epic was the fight against Zeus, nobody thought that atom would make him fight That was such an awesome fight. I was on the edge of my seat during the whole scene It's amazing that they bet $ 100,000 that Atom would not last the round, it's crazy Too crazy for me, I would have lost my mind trying to bet that kinda money Did it seem fair to you that Zeus won?

ok I guess theyre misinformed they did get an A from Cinema Score tho Yes. Under "critical response" I see that they mention that Maleficent demolishes stereotypes that were only tweaked in "Frozen." I suppose they're referring to showing a movie from the perspective of the antagonist.

Hey? Hi whats up? Im good, how are you? in the mood for some drama movie? Good good, yeah sure, any recommendations? Are you a fan of Jesse Eisenberg? The movie is called The Social Network. Ohh, nice, I havent watch it yet. It is definitely worth checking out, I mean right now facebook kind of sucks but still lol. Hahaha yeah, its been a while since that movie came out too right? Right right. It came out 2010. Cant believe 2010 is 8 years ago already. Oh shit youre right, God. So tell me more about the movie if it is worth getting back to. Sure, well I think you already know a little bit of the plot, or what's it about haha., Yeah, kind of, is it how the creator of facebook well created Facebook right? In a way haha, but in depth the film portrays the founding of the social networking site and the resulting lawsuits. Ohhh right right. I kind of knew that lol. About the lawsuits. Yeah, it somewhat grounds the story to that. Okay, any other actors I should know about thats in the movie? Other than Jesse haha. Justin Timberlake, Armie Hammer, Andrew Garfield is in the movie too. Say what? The cast is impressive, lol. It is. You should watch it because it really tells the origins of the guy himself that created facebook. Okay. Yeah im a bit interested. So is it just a drama movie? Whats the score again or the rating of the movie? Yeah, but the director is David Fincher, in my opinion one of the best. Rating of 9/10. and a Rotten Tomatoes score of 96%. David Fincher! Im a big fan too! And wow that rating...

considering every thing else is 80% or more yes that movie scored well I am very excited about the deadpool 2 movie as well So what exactly does S.H.I.E.L.D stand for do you know? I am assuming it is shield because Captain America is the leader correct? But it is an cranium so what do the individual letters stand for? yes captain america is the leader i don't know about  SHIELD stands for do you know THANOS stands for No i dont think so 6 gem stones are stands for his names totally 6 infinity stones interesting he was the biggest villain in upcoming avengers infinity war movie he has the power of 6 infinity stones Ah. I have heard good things about that movie so far. so no one can't kill hhim that movie will be released in 2 months So the character Loki he is the Villain correct? My roomate has a cat named Loki wow interesting
Yes, Daisy Buchanan is his former lover and another characters wife. That sounds juicy! Lol What actor is playing her wife? That would be Carey Mulligan. Is there any blackmail involved in this movie? I wouldn't go as far as blackmail. But there is plenty of hatred between Tom Buchanan and Jay Gatsby Does anyone die in the movie? Yes, would you like me to give it away? Can I guess first? Yes Does the billionaire die? Yes he does Is there a specific time period that this movie takes place in?

Fair enough. Yes . It was directed by christopher nolan whom I love as well. Yes, he is a good director.  It also starred Leonardo DiCaprio. I am surprised it only got 86% on rotten tomatoes. Leo as Cobb was a great role. The idea of a specialist in infratrating dreams is so unique. The rotten tomatos score was similar to the 8.8 if got from IMDB. I thought it would have been higher... Who was your favorite character? Ifany.. I liked Arthur, played by Joseph-Gordon Levitt. I liked him. I think mine was Tom Hardy as Eames. He was good as well.  What did you think of Ellen Page as Ariadne? I liked her. She was very talented at creating dreamscapes. They were able to create a good team. So did I.  Hard to believe it's already been 9 years since the movie came out. Wow that is unreal. I think this  had so many unique ideas. I do think it was pretty immoral in a way though. Going after Fischer and manipulating him with his father dying aspect. I agree - the movie explored some very serious issues.
what happened to him ? i cycle through canada on the weekend . was in a car crash . i only broke my arm . which i have done cycling too hat is terrible ! i am sorry to hear that . do you go cycling too ? ot much after breaking my arm . i like going out and socializing more ww . where do you go to socialize ?

yes,a great era of liberation and the theme of how the wealthy always care about money as the bottom line while the rest of the world  can die off for all they care! Whenever I'm reading books that are made into movies, I try to treat them as two seperate things, in order to not be disappointed. And yeah. Very sad! I read the book back in high school-but isn't there a scene where someone gets hit by a car and Daisy just could care less?

I forgot that Terrance Howard was in this movie I agree, i'm not a big superhero fan The effects were good. Yes, the rocket propelled grenade action was good All in all the whole story was a bit like spiderman. I see that the criticism is mixed-maybe they weren't really fans either I did like the "military thriller"-style feeing in the beginning one critc mentioned. But the movie rated quite good on the platforms. I am still wondering what the relevance to military was They were trying to build new missilies for the military. oh, ok That makes sense I did not like the whole thing about the heart symbolism and the magnet protecting his heart from the shrapnels.
i cannot get any pets because i still live in my parents home i live with my dad . i have not seen by mom since i was 3 . it must be hard to grow up with both parents . . . . what do you do for living ? she is in a nut house now . i work as an accountant . i wish i had a fixed job too . my work requires a lot of travel . have you ever been to ireland ? i want to go look for a leprechaun . o i have never , also leprechauns are green . i prefer red instead i believe they exist . i need to find a new hair stylist . is the current one doing a bad job ? i can help you search on my iphone

Yeah, I was honestly thinking the same thing. There are actually a bunch of films she's in that I didn't realize she was in until much later. Loved the Walken character. Really memorable given how little he was actually on screen. Also I think this was the first DiCaprio movie I really thought he acted super well in. I mean the others are good too but this to me was the start of him being as good as he is now. Totally agree about Walken.  He's great in this. oh I've been a big Leo fan for a while.  I truly thought he was mentally disabled in What's Eating Gilbert Grape.  He's super versatile, he just seems to get a lot of the same brash characters. The fact that movie is based on a real person is so crazy to me. I liked the scene it's talking about, where he poses as the teacher. He did that well. He was convincing but you could tell it was his first con and he wasn't as polished as later on. Can you imagine having that much nerve?  Especially as a teenager.

Teeny was a mistake on my part, I was thinking genre at that time. Mean girl is about high school kids bullying. I feel it is very fitting with what is happenng in Today's society That sounds interesting.   Is Mean Girls the name of the movie we are chatting about? Yes, my apologies for giving the wrong name. The movie is very engaging and puts bullying into a comedic light. It's entertaining and eye openeing as well Would it be appropriate to watch with my 12 year old granddaughter? I would say yes, I am sure she is faced with these issues in school. It may even give her some strategies to use Can you name any other actors in the movie? Racheal Adams, Lacey Chabert, Amanda Seyfreid and Lizzy Caplan Tina Fey was the director Thank you. What about language and or violence? Nice!  I love Tina Fey! Its a teenage movie, so the violence is no existant I don't recall swearing perfect! the main Character was homeschooled and now has to join the rest of the kids in public school her parents were zoologists abroad they were in africa My grandchildren are homeschooled. I imagine the eldest would enjoy it!  Thank you. That was my next question-where does it take place?

I would! As I said, I've seen in a bunch There are some lines that I know by heart I also love that they really did a good job with the voices and the characters that they are playing So let me see here it's about a bunny who wants to be a police officer? Yep, pretty much And rabbits aren't supposed to make good police officers? lol No because in this society they are supposed to be cute and cuddly Oh okay so and underdog story!? I love those It is indeed Again, it is really cute. Like most good animation movies there are lots of subtle things in it as well I really like most animated movies.  Tangled, Frozen, the one with the singing elephant i forget what it's called lol So i'm sure I would like it It sounds like it I think it would be somethign you would watch several times hahaha it seems like an animated, action, comedy, mystery I think thats a pretty good description actually I think I actually ended up buying the movie Should I watch with my nieces?  I'm sure theyve already seen it though It it's one for the collection? they might like to see it again? I'm sure they would lol I hadn't bought it at first but my kids wanted to see if so badly and so often i just figured it was worth it. good talk! Thanks for the recommendation
i also prefer things from long ago simpler times of life .
hello, What is the name of the movie? Hi, the movie we are talking about today is Maleficent. Have you seen it? Maleficent...oh ok...is that a disney movie ? i have not seen it, but am thinking about whether i will see it or not It is based off of the 1959 Disney film Sleeping Beauty Did you like the movie ? Would you recommend it ? Yes, it manages to be improbably entertaining to watch due solely to the title character Who plays the title character? Angelina Jolie plays the title character. Do you like movies she is in? Oh yes, i do like movies that she is in. And i imagine she would make a great Maleficent too It got a CinemaScore of A i am interested in watching the movie. What would you rate it ? I would agree with Rotten Tomatoes and give it a 51% Do you usually watch superhero movies? Is it a very long movie, i dont usually like movies that are very long and drawn out Yes i have watched many superhero movies I am not sure how long the movie is but it didn't seem to feel like is dragged on it sounds like it is a good movie then Elle Fanning is also in this movie Do you like movies she is in? Does she play Sleeping Beauty? i cant think of any other movies that she was in right now. Yes, she plays Aurora. Maleficent does not like her in the beginning but grows to care for her.

that's a great idea awesome. thanks for your advice! have a good day!
Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams. They both do a fantastic job, but I think the real power of that movie comes from the story itself. If you want an escape from reality, that's the movie to check out. Hmm I do like both of those actors. Can you tell me a little about the plot? Without ruining it, all I can say is that it's a love story set in the 1940's. That sounds like a very interesting movie. Do the actors get along well? That's what's great about it, in a way they get a long, but there is also a lot of tension there because of events that happen in the movie. It sounds like it's dramatic. I do like those sort of movies. How does the supporting cast work ini t? The supporting cast is good. Everything fits into place nicely, James Marsden, and Joan Allen. I don't want to ruin anything by telling you too much about their roles, but they all give respectable performances. I can understand that. What's the general setting of the movie? It's set most in South Carolina, and you can feel the southern warmth it has. Honestly, when my girlfriend first told me a about the movie, I wasn't all that interested in it, because typically I don't like romance movies, but this one got me. That sounds more pleasant than the nice freezing weather I'm experiencing here. How long is it? It's been a while since I've seen the movie, and I can't remember the actual run time, but I think it's a little bit longer than a normal movie. The thing is, when it ends, you don't want it to end, so... it doesn't feel too long or anything.
o . i just like to pretend that i am a tiger . very cool . i like hot wings oo . i have a joke for you . why did the chicken cross the road ? please do tell i need to know now tell me now tell me o escape the crazed chef !

I have not, but I've heard some things about it. What's good about it? Monsters University​ is a 2013 American 3D computer-animated comedy film produced by PixarAnimation Studios for Walt Disney Pictures.[6] It was directed by Dan Scanlon and produced byKori Rae, with John Lasseter, Pete Docter, Andrew Stanton and Lee Unkrich as executiveproducers. The music for the film was composed by Randy Newman, marking his seventhcollaboration with Pixar. It was the fourteenth feature film produced by Pixar, and is a prequel to2001's Monsters, Inc., marking the first time Pixar has made a prequel film.[7] Monsters Universitytells the story of two monsters, Mike and Sulley, and their time studying at college, where theystart off as rivals, but slowly become best friends. John Goodman, Billy Crystal, Steve Buscemi,Bob Peterson, and John Ratzenberger reprise their roles as James P. Sullivan, Mike Wazowski,Randall Boggs, Roz, and the Abominable Snowman, respectively. Bonnie Hunt, who played Ms.Flint in the first film, voices Mike's grade school teacher Ms. Karen Graves. is a comedy and animation movie! Seems solid enough, should I watch it with people? i guess! is for kids! but is a good one! to see with your friends! is funny! I figured. Is it better than Monsters Inc. at all? I always hear people talk about how great Monsters Inc was/ Would like to know if it compares yes is better! i prefer M.U How about as a Disney movie? Is it better than other disney movies? You there? Well that depends on what kind of movies you like, even if they are all cartoons Disney has several types of them! I know, but in your opinion, is it better than movies like the Lion King or Finding Nemo? Like I said, in YOUR opinion never be better than those two! neverrrrr! I thought so. I might still check it out regardless. i think the lion king is the best movie of disney! well we talking about M:U
my parents were terrible people .
That was redemption Yes, and the kiss of true love was not that of the prince. Not like children's fairy tale, was it? When Aurora finds her wings it's amazing the way she flies No the fairy tale didn't have much redemption for Maleficent
before becoming rich i also had anxiety being a full time mom is the root cause having millions of dollars i hire many nannies ice my husband works all day how long have you been married ? oo long i am pregnant again . do you ever play the lottery ?
hat sounds really difficult and stressful
also do you think a dogs life warrants the killing of so many people have u seen during 2014 or recently recently yes how did you like it? i enjoyed it, i know i would be very upset if someone killed my pet howabout you
It looks like it came out to mixed reviews 65 out of 100 or 6.8 out of 10 seems pretty low especially for an animated movie but I guess rotten tomato thought it was OK they gave it a good score at least we get to see when mike first meets sully How did they first meet ? at mosters university they both aspire to be a scarer Did they share a dorm together something like that
hat is cool i like to fish but i always throw the fish back i do not fish . i never do .
i love its about to be fall ! yeah ? why do you love fall ? i love green an i love playing tennis ! do you play tennis with your significant other ? o with my dad he is a veteran . my dad is an actor i love to laugh at funny movies ! is he in any ? yeah , but i do not watch them i hate the idea of acting oh really ? why ? do you like music instead ? i like music o one of my 3 wives did so i do not like it much now i like fall because of the colors !
well that is good . there is nothing wrong with that . you like music ? yes , i listen to gospel music and slow jams .
It was written by Peter Benchley. how's the acting I suppose the acting is good due to the direction of Steven Spielberg. does the shark do a lot of damage It starts with the shark pulling a woman that is skinny dipping down in the ocean. Her name is chrissie Watkins and her remains are found on shore the next day. that sound scary what do they do about the shark I know.  Of course then the police chief wants to close the beach for safety but the mayor says no due to the tourist season and summer economy. What I can't believe is that because of the mayor the coroner changes his ruling from shark attack to boat attack. wow what ashame The place a bounty on the shark after he attacks another person. did someone take it The local fisherman do catch a shark, a tiger shark. They assume that that's the killer shark. but i assume that the shark comes again Oh yeah, on the fourth of July it comes up and kills the police chief's son. Did you know that jaws is actually supposed to be a great white shark? that is intresting were they able to stop the shark I think one of the best scenes is when the police chief, the shark expert, and the shark hunter all get together to on the shark hunter's boat, the Orca.
i am good thank you , and you ? ood , its saturday so i am going kayaking today .
i how are you today i am doing okay . how are you ? ood today . . its a good whether here in seattle hat is nice . my wife wants to visit soon . i am more for mexico . i prefer the sunny whether too . . yes . she was miss usa . now i just wonder if she married me for my money . r you kidding me . . where u stay ? o . it has me kind of down tonight . i am from new york city . kook . . i am a one handed person while it come for typing . . apologies for late reply its okay . what happen to your other hand if you do not mind me asking .
I were going to ask what happens at the end but I will wait to see it I enjoy chatting with you. have a good day Thanks you too
what do you like about it? i liked it because of quality of making just awesome work by all of them yeah, it's well-paced and beautiful to look at. were you familiar with the background of Bruce Wayne becoming an orphan before you saw this film? no are you male or female? this document mentions all the world travels done by Bruce, and how he is trained by the Justive League. I thought this part was awesome. yea Or I guess its called the League of Shadows and Ra's al Ghul. Liam Neeson was the man in this. yea The Carmine Falcone character was just too minor a role for me to get into. What did you think of the mastermind plot of Ghul with the water supply? awesome Scarecrow was pretty creepy and cool too.
o still living the single life
cool what u do for fun i like the guitar , i can play it !
It seemed to drag along, It was also lame to me that he helped the FBI, even after they captured him and used him as a pawn. Did you enjoy Tom Hanks character? you mentioned the film was genuinely funny, do you think that added to the biographical crime drama or added to it ? I think it took away from the seriousness of the film Im surprised he did all those crimes at such a young age though You commented that it was lame that the FBI used him after his capture. However, as mentioned above it is biographical this is what he did in real life and totally agree about how young he was. Just before his 19th birthday Do you think Franks circumstances justified his actions? Do you feel for him? Yes I do, stealing from the rich is the best to do in aiding to equality, the federal government used him like a slave id never have helped them what is your opinion on it? Well he posed as a Pan American World Airways Pilot, I think that posed a huge threat. Imagine the passengers finding out he is not a real pilot. This story takes place in 1963 and beyond. Do you think it was easier to commit a crime such as what Frank did portrayed in this movie?
lol . . . i can say the same as well . what do you do for your free time ? i relax . can i offer you an egg in this trying time ?
I think 79 % is high enough for an animated comedy film. Who is your favorite character in this movie? it starts with a 7yr old monster who want to be a scarer, which is a monster who enters the human world at night to scare kids I like Mike. Looks like its an interesting movie. the movie even has a fraternity lol
It's funny too. It's got a lot of fantasy in it. I like the music, a lot of jazz. It's shot in LA and it's really entertaining. The name of the movie is called La La Land The cast is Ryan Gosling, Emma Stone, John Legend, and Callie Hernandez Gosling stars as Sebastian and he acts as a snob, but he and Emma who plays as Mia, falls in love. Have you seen any movies with any of these cast before? If you like love stories, I would suggest you go see it. It actually gives great pointers for relationships. It's rates 8.6 out of 10 by Rotten Tomatoes, 93/100 by Metatcritics, and 8.1/10 my IMDB. So, I would say very good ratings and it's deserved. This is a very great movie. How interested are you in taking a look at this movie? HELLO, ARE YOU STILL THERE???? You need to chat back in order to finish this conversation and complete the HIT... This movie is a very family friendly movie as well. What do you think?
bully for you ! he did not get a dwi did he ? i am studying law
i just got out of college and have an education degree . ood for you . i do not think i could teach . do you like it ?
The first scene sounds like a doozy, have you ever had trouble with older siblings? lol yes I did they made for great stories later on in life You should love the opening then, at the very least, crazy things happen from the get go. The film surprisingly, didn't have that good of a critical reception at the time it was released. Do you usually listen to critics?
oh wow . that sounds rough . sorry to hear that well hope you sleep well my friend and thanks sure . thank you too my friend well i do got to get some sleep money is always nice money and sleep are hard to come by sometimes should come to zoo with me
For sure, he's an impeccable actor
I think I may have seen bits and pieces of it. Ah I see. Then you probably know that Ben Affleck played Batman and Henry Cavil was superman right? I knew the Ben affleck one, but not the other one My son loves these types of movies, he is 11. Oh, yea Henry Cavil did a really good job as superman. The movie received bad reviews, but really, it was a decent movie. I'd recommend watching it all when you are bored sometime. Yea it's a great movie for children It definitely entertains them. Did the movie end up with a winner of the 2? If you have seen the older superman movies, it actually continues off from them. I would say no, but if you were forced to pick a winner at the end, it would be Batman He really just outsmarts him over and over again. But of course, they end up teaming up in the end. Batman is the brains i guess lol I wanna say that movie came out in 2014? lol yea, it's pretty ridiculous but batman always wins close, 2016 actually. newer than i thought
yes . i have a beautiful family . we are all vegan . i often wonder why i am not married yet because your soul mate is still searching for you . hat makes me feel a little better .

I like both of them Jim has a lot of range Definitely. It's great. Morgan plays God and gives his divine powers to Jim for a week. If anyone could play God it would be Morgan Yeah. It only has a 48% on Rotten Tomatoes which is weird. But it got an A on cinemaScore. Is it very funny? Yeah it's hilarious. High-concept comedy. sounds like one to watch Absolutely. Carrey plays this TV field reporter, Bruce Nolan. His rival at the news station is played by Steve Carell.

Oh my gosh, I forgot she was in this movie! she is good WHat did you think of Tom Shadyac as a Director? I thought he did a good job. The movie seemed like it had some creative writing.

It was an average of 5.7 out of 10 It does seem a little low, especially given that the CinemaScore was an A What did you think of the slapstick comedy? I think it's great.

I might watch it on hot tub night. Who is the director ? John Lee hancock what else has he directed? I am not sure and tim plays quinton? The movie is based on Michael Oher's upbringing. and follows him as he goes from the projects to a Christian school and then is adopted by Sean and Leigh Ann Touhy. Tim play Sean Touhy Quinton plays Michael Oher Michael Oher was drafted by the Baltimore Ravens. It sounds neat to watch his upbringing. Sean and leigh were well off? Are the ravens a good team?

Yup! I also found it kind of funny that what caused the savage behavior in the animals was literally a drug developed from a plant (night howlers). It was kind of social commentary in a way.
i totally believe in them , aliens that is . i could say that is where some of the crazy music sounds come from .
yes was a magnificent thriller Do you like scary movies? yes I like My favorite part of the movie was how casual the people were. What was your favorite part of the movie? This defiantly was not a kid friendly film. Would you agree Are you still there? My favorite parts from the movie was the sympathy for shark s vitims yes I am here Yes I can agree it was great to see how the victims reacted and their families. Sharks can be very vicious creatures. yes that s true It seems crazy that it is such an old movie But still I love it Like it’s a new movie. Yes mee to I think we are done with the number of responses? I do not know, I think yes Do you have any more comments regarding the movie? I do not have any comments you?
It is basically sleeping beauty as told by the 'evil' queen. Oh like Wicked the Play I think so, yes. Have you seen that?
cool ! i enjoy posting on instagram . what kinds of things are you into posting ? sports things . i need to be practicing soccer . hat is awesome , i love sports . i enjoy anything where i can be outside . i am obsessed with working out and being great . ice ! i am a bit of a fitness fanatic myself . my favorite is hiking . what is yours ? soccer ! i also enjoy basketball and running . ll great activities ! what else are you into ? what kind of food do you like ? i eat very healthy . mainly veggies . i enjoy healthy eating as well . i will admit , though , i have a weakness for burritos . oh . my weakness is oreos . well that is an understandable weakness , oreos are delicious ! what do you do for a living ?
i am great . just taking a break at work . i fix airplanes , what do you do ? hat sounds like hard work . my parents own a restaurant so i help them restaurant work is fun , it keeps you moving , you never stand still . i mostly help with the inventory and make sure it runs smoothly what kind of car do you drive ? mine is a junker , no one would want it . i drive an old dodge it still runs pretty good . do you have any sisters brother for me . do you like music ? i have a vintage vinyl collection . i am the youngest of 6 sisters . yeah i like kane brown
I like both of them. The movie sounds good. How long is it? It's 153 minutes so it's fairly long.  There's a part where Bruce Wayne/Batman seeks out kryptonite in the Indian Ocean as a deterrent. It didn't get very good critics scores. That is a long movie. I enjoy long movies, especially in the theaters. It sounds interesting. What did the critics have to say about it? CinemaScore graded it as a B, Rotten Tomatoes 4.9/10 and Metacritic Score was 44/100. One of the critics said it wasn't as good as Dark Knight but it was better than Man of Stee. Steel. Wow. Those are really low scores! I am surprised at that. Usually these types of movies are popular and do well. Yeah, agreed.  In one part of the movie, Superman's mom gets kidnapped and the kidnapper demands he kill Batman for his Mom's release. And what happens once his mom is released? She isn't released that way, because Batman realizes right before he kills Superman that they are both being tricked.  Batman ends up rescuing Superman's Mom, and Superman goes after the kidnapper. Does Superman have a fight with kidnapper? And who wins
I completely agree.  I believe there is good in most situations.  The good out of this one is of course Enigma. And to deal with our sexuality at a time when it was so taboo. Indeed. How wonderful Mr. Turing must have felt having the support from his colleagues.  They would not hear of Mr. Turing's dismissal! Mr. Turing and Miss Clarke seem to have found a mutually beneficial relationship in the end: he would not be lonely and she would be free of her parents. I agree.
i drive a truck with 4 wheel drive . i can barley see over the wheel . wow driving a truck sounds more fun than selling paper

A bit jumbled at times. Did the cinematography wow you? Yeah, Zack Snyder is great with effects Did Wonder Woman really fit in in this movie? If so, did Wonder Woman make the movie better or worse? She did fit it definitely made it better What was your favorite scene? When Batman and Superman engage in combat loved all of those scenes What was your favorite scene? When Batman sees Superman as a threat humanity How do you feel about the rating for this movie? Right on target What would you rate this movie from 1 to 4 stars? A 2 Did Ben Affleck fit the role as Batman? Certainly. How did you like Diane Lane? She did fine. How does this compare to previous Batman movies? It sucked. Many of the Batman movies before this one were better Did you think the movie was a little to long?

Doesn't say how long it is. The Rotten Tomatoes score is  86% Wow, that's impressive. I like to look at Rotten Tomatoes when debating whether or not to see a movie. Do you know the director? Something about Dom Cobb infiltrates peoples dreams in a dream world. The director is Christopher nolan Heard of him? Wow I thought this was recent but it came out in 2009. He directed The Dark Knight which I enjoy. Yeah, I know it's been out awhile but 2009 does seem to be a while back now. Time flies. Do you know if it won any awards? or how much it made at the box office? Oh wow I loved the dark night movies. And it doesn't say if it's won awards or how much at box office. A critic did say it could be "weirder" The concept seems interesting and it has a good lead actor as well as director and reviews. I think it must be good. The plot does seem weird, that's for sure. Tom Hardy is in the movie as the character Earnes. And yeah the plot is a bit strange. I might watch this movie now. I think I may as well. I can't say I've heard of Tom Hardy however. Is there any other supporting actors? Oh Earnes is a sharp tongue associate of Cobb. Ellen Page Oh, cool. I am familiar with her. She's in a number of good movies and is great.
hat is very kind of you . i like to help people . i know what its like to be in a difficult place . i do not make as much as i would like with sales . i do not make that much here either , but it pays the bills . i supplement with a job at a gas station

Yes it is! Is it funny? It is funny. RDJ definitely is witty and snarky. He makes for excellent comedic relief What is your favorite thing about it? My favorite thing would have to be how the whole cast is an all star cast. So you know your getting talented actors who know how to fulfill their rolls. Joss Whedon also is a great director that a lot of people can stand behind Do you like Superhero Movies?

Safe, predictable, edge-free....yeah, that critic one got bored. also that it wasnt inspired Its wild that people come up with these ideas, i dont think its boring at all. like oozma kappa! The two take jobs in the mail room, then work their way up to join the scare team. I like how this movie ties the first in so well. simulation bedroom... hahaha A true underdog story, Hardscrabble was mean. Bu she turned around in the end. They were the first to surprise her. Now I feel like watching it. its been awhile
Yeah--I always forget that that the basis for Iron Man comes from the other guy he was imprisoned with. He's such a dynamic actor and I rather liked seeing him as the bad guy
how are you liking it ? it is good . i go outside and play and dance a lot
what ? ? i like surfing anytime i get a chance .
yes especially since my parents gave me the recorder . hat was very nice of them
llo hello , hope all is well today for you ! hank you i am really busy lately , but managing the restaurant with my brothers is great ! where are you from ? originally , from cheyenne where my family is from i am in cali driving a decent vehicle is important here ! snow is no fun .

Jennifer Aniston was in it really, I like her also. She is very subtle yeah, she plays the girlfriend in the movie
It’s insane that it has such a high rotten tomatoes score, too. Then again it is a cinematic masterpiece, even now.
Yes overall I thought it was really a great movie. The acting was overall really good as well. You'd really believe Robert Downey Jr. was the character. It was amazing watching him metamorphisze from being totally self absorbed to caring about others - at least enough to rescue the world. Does he play something of an anti-hero? I always like those characters. I suppose you can say that. It is really a good guy. He just wrestles with the idea of being good and caring about others even before he builds the Iron Man suit.
y friends and i love to sunbathe all day . do you own a home ?
i can , but that sprite caused me to boat i am trying to learn how to cook italian you could cook for me . i would like that , i want to also make dessert . what kind ? i love brownies

No more of a home body especially with films like these.You? How did you like the ending? It was an "ok" ending. What did you think? I am like you! I find that the cost of theater movies is so high these days. I guess he got his his vengeance?. But not his dog!! LoL Yeah it can be pretty costly, I feel the movie has to be at least worth it.
It is a little ridiculous to think that a man fighting superman and aliens wont kill But you can't think of it like it's the "real" batman. It's an alternate universe. But batman is probably a catholic hah jk yes, but the comics batman doesn't kill. It's a very big thing with him. What was your favorite actor or actress in the film?
yes i would like it Sure thing! One of the key scenes starts as follows: In 1940, during the fall of France, hundreds of thousands of Allied soldiers have retreated toDunkirk. Tommy, a young British private, is the sole survivor of a German ambush. At thebeach, he finds thousands of troops awaiting evacuation and meets Gibson, who is buryinga body. After a German dive-bomber attack, they find a wounded man. They rush hisstretcher onto a hospital ship, but are denied passage themselves. The ship is sunk by dive-bombers; Tommy saves Alex, another soldier. They leave at night on a destroyer, which issunk by a torpedo from a U-Boat. Gibson saves Tommy and Alex, and they are broughtashore by a rowing boat. What do you think of that?
my siblings and i are planning to do some odd jobs for the neighbors . you ? i have to go to work .

That whole stockbrocker lifestyle is crazy.  Drugs and constantly working is so crazy.  Do you remember the scene about when Jordan takes a job in penny stocks? I do remember that scene, he took the job on Long Island. What did you think about his pitching style when he got hired there? He was so aggressive but he got the money made! I wish I had those skills. He did, I feel like he was overly aggressive though, but maybe he felt like he had to after Black Monday. that had to be a crazy time. Yeah I can't believe he got fired then.  It's hard to believe that this was all set in 1987.

She saved the world them and seems ready to do it again! the revealing scene of Diana to be the Godkiller was nice She was Zeus' daughter. yes And the idea of inherent human corruption was compelling. conclusion was predicted Yet Diana still found the good in humans. thats why she spares Maru I was surprised when Sir Patrick ended up being Ares! The present day Diana was also great What if Diana had gone along with Ares to destroy mankind? Would have been a different movie for sure. yes I agree Seems all set for a sequal or 5. yes she  has given us a clue by saying that her new mission to fight and give on the world's behalf I'm not huge on super hero movies, but Wonder Woman was different. Good. I am not of drama type but liked this Steve sacrificing himself was sort of like a Jesus moment.

He's an accomplice of DiCaprio in this movie so he definitely gets plenty of screentime Great? How about Joseph Gordon Levitt? What's his role? He's the main partner of DiCaprio who basically plans and researches the missions Would you happen to know who the screenwriter of the film is? I don't but there are a lot of cool scenes that you'll want to watch out for. There's a point in the movie where if you die in a dream you'll end up in "limbo" that makes a lot of the scenes intense

That is currently showing OK then I guess it’s monster university I haven’t seen it yet but it seems like it might be good kid movie Looks like it got a 79% on rotten tomatoes so did OK-ish Oh I have not watched that, isn't that a Pixar movie? It just changed what movie I was looking at again I’m so sorry I don’t know what’s going God I now have maleficent That is weird? What one is itnow Maleficent Which I also haven’t seen but I think it’s a Disney movie It got a 51% on rotten tomatoes which seems much worse Okay I think something is messed up.. it should only be be one movie the whole time.. I guess should we abort conversation?

Yes , Zootopia has a rating of 98 percent out of 100 which means its a very good movie that anyone could enjoy watching Even though it came out in 2016 until today its a very popular movie Yes..my friends and family should watch this movie, its movie really liked Yes...sure Ofcourse althought it surprises me that when it comes to movies about animation and for kids only men direct the movies , i would like to watch women get in it and be more active in movies like this Yes. Defiantly true its very more active You heard of Shakira ? shes a bilingual singer shes very famous she makes the voice of the Fox which is a cop in the movie is the main character Ohhh..

Hi I haven't seen this movie yet. Which movie? I have a document up for John Wick.  do you have it too?
what is making you feel so unsure ?
Hello Yes, have you? Yes, did you like it?
it is actually very hard work , but totally worth it .
what do you do for a living ? i am a construction worker
hello is anybody there? Yes, hello. i don't seem to have a document - do you know what the movie is? It is Zootopia. Have you seen it? I remember that - yes I saw it a year or two ago I supposed to convince you to see it, but since you already have I am not sure what we are to do now. maybe you could convince me to watch it online again for free :-) :) I'll try!  My family had mixed feelings about it. well, I thought it was fun. I did too.  It was not what I expected.  We thought the scene with the sloth character was fun. I guess if you liked it and have nothing better to watch, you should give it another shot.  It is funny, but can be kind of intense for younger viewers when Judy and Nick discover what is going on.  Did that convince you? Oh yes, that was great. The main character was a bunny who is not taken seriously. What sort of mixed feelings did you have? My kids found it scary when the animals turned wild. I had not thought about the kids feelings - I'm 72 & went by myself. But judy eventually is hero & everybody that didn't think she could do it was wrong - if only life were so simple.
What a great movie that was, Macaulay Culkin had an amazing performance! I thought it was ok. But lacked in reality a lot Yeah, it was definitely unrealistic, a young kid isn't going to defend a house against a couple thiefs. Not up to the usual John Hughes standards I suppose a kid could just shoot them though
I have not seen that yet Yeah it's much better than this movie

I highly doubt it! But who knows. I wonder how much of this movie was embellished for hollywood. The story does indeed sound incredible, which I'm sure is why they made it into a movie. He winds up getting a deal working with the FBI in their check fraud department. But, you know, they always change things Yeah, they do. Yeah, I mean, committing millions of dollars worth of fraud and ending up with a job with the FBI doesn't sound too bad, lol Definitely could have been worse... In the end he gets out of his prison sentence and winds up living a pretty decent lift. Omg, right! Where do I sign up! Lol haha Well, at least he ends up using his talents for something good, I guess. Yeah. But he probably only helped to get himself out of jail. This document pretty much tells the whole story... I wonder if I should watch it now, hah. I don't blame the guy though! You totally should! You won't be disappointed!
i do not drink either . i just do not like irt ! well shakes help me sleep i need a solid 8 hrs a night do you ? i think i am ok with 6
Yea, a huge plot twist! I did not see it coming Using Ludendorf and Maru in the process - neat

It has a good rating on rotten tomatoes not exactly cool what is it's imdb rating? its about corporate espionate using an experimental technology 8.8/10 wow that's high i know it was made in 2009 kinda old did the critics like it? yes it has 3 key scenes

About being honest and to pursue your dream Nick the fox tried to trick Judy but eventually they become friends. Oh right, it's starting to come back to me now. Yes.. and apparently, Nick was bullied because people consider him untrustworthy as a fox Ah right, he was trying to join boy scouts or something like that but was bullied for being a fox. That is so sad... I think it's still about racism and prejudice, the movie's moral theme, that is Yes.. some people just assume and judge other people

It was made in 2010, so it has been out for a bit, but it isn't outdated. I'm not sure exactly how he trains the dragon, but it is based off of a book. I see, I wonder if I should read the book first?  I try not to do that because the book will typically ruin the movie for me.  The movies can never quite capture the details or feelings I get from a book.  Well I will definitely have to give the movie a try and see what it is all about. I think you will love the onscreen adaption of it. It's got witty animation and intelligent dialogue. The animation paired with the content will be perfect for you and your children. That sounds great!  Well I think I have made my decision and I thank you for your time and insight.  Have a great day! You're welcome. I am glad I could help you! Now if I could only get this to move forward so I can finish my task and go watch this movie. Who makes the movie?
well , i love spending time with my 3 kids , how about you ? i like to pretend to be other people .

i , want to chat with me ? sure do ! tell me about yourself . well i am a mom with five little kids hat is gross ! i hate kids oh no . i love babies hey are the worst ! i can not deal with any kids and will never have any
oh, yeah? well, The scene where Sebastian slips into a passionate jazz improvisation sounds intriguing! Apparently he goes on to play in a 1980's cover band! Sure but it didn't seem like he was really playing the piano. oh thats disappointing. some say the movie does sag in the middle.
I don’t know You would recommend this movie? Yes I think it worth watching First you have the cast Second you have agreat story Who stars in the movie? Third the post has a good rtaing Meryl Streep Tom Hanks Sarah Pulson Bob Odenkirk Did it win any awards? I’m not sure Do you know if it has been released on DVD yet?

Yes, the palace she created for herself was stunning. I didn't realize the snow monster had a name. I didn't know that either, but I like his name "Marshmallow". I'm so happy that Elsa could escape from her cell. And I do like Olaf, he is so cute!
i dance alone , i do not like touching other people oh okay . you a boy with long hair ? o i am a female
I feel the way. Most of the characters are irredeemable Who was your favorite character? I think DiCaprios character was my favorite. He drove the story\ WHo was yours? I liked Margot Robbie's character.  She didn't take DiCaprio's crap when he cheated.  She was smart and strong. Do you agree with the ratings in the document? I think theyr'e accurate. It's a movie I enjoy when it comes on, but I don't consider it one of my favorite movies Do you agree with the ratings? I agree.  For me it was worth watching but I would not seek it out to watch again. My favorite scene was when Margot Robbie learns that DiCaprio cheated on her and she is being enticing but then puts her heal in his face when he tries to get close to her. I don't remember that scene They're all very untrustworthy Do you think three years was enough of a sentence?

I do. They are some of my favorite movies. I like anything Science Fiction and Fantasy. I love them, mainly Marvel mostly but as far as DC movies go this Batman trilogy is better than the others out. Hard to believe this came out in 05! Ya. I like Marvel movies. The Avengers movies are great! You'll prolly enjoy this film. I think i would have if I knew that it was so bloody long Ya. I might need to look into that movie. Oh man, the Avengers are so fantastic! It's great how they built those characters up to where it's like I care about what happens to them or whatever, fantastic job. Ya. I am looking forward to more movies that Marvel might come out with. Another thing I didn't like much about Batman trilogy was how dark it was....I know that has something to do with his persona or whatever but man, have lunch in a well lit dining room or something

Big time actors who are some of them? Idris Elba, Jason Bateman the director is Byron Howard and apparently Rich Moore. Both directing. oh cool! definitely want to see it now does it have a good plot? Theres a crime that takes place and they have a limited time to solve it. So they go on a bit of an adventure. nice! is it funny? I would say it definitely enjoyable and funny. Great animation and the budget is high. The animals have their own police department. yeah a lot of my friends have seen it and said it's a great movie haha that sounds interesting its very anthropomorphic is it an all ages movie? Definitely all-ages.

I do not think that as the critics say though that the characters are dull people to start with, made duller by their delusions. They have to be brave to did what they did in corruption. Yeah it was definitely corrupt in the end, the FBI gets involved They all get in trouble I think Yes most times they do not get away stuff. Leonardo DiCaprio makes every movie interesting. Jonah Hill is also in it it's funny as hell I would think it is a serious movie with the corruption. It had great reviews 75/100 on meracritic and 7.8 I see now it says it is a black comedy. It is dark comic material. Do you like the actors? Just maybe Leonardo DiCaprio. The director Martin Scorsese is a good director. Really? I haven't heard of him it was such a good movie though, I definitely would agree He is the director of this movie. I wonder why they call it "black comedy"? Was this based on a book or memoir? I think that is when something is comical but it's based on immoral things. oh I se yeah it was definitely not a PG movie I think it was R or wasn't rated it had lots of drugs, prostitution and violence I see that. I wouldn't want to see it. Yeah, it's a hard movie if you don't like that stuff It's about the stock market and wall street are you familiar?
i really like to eat pizza
hat is awesome . i live in georgia . where are you from ? i also live in georgia . what kind of music do you listen to ? i do not listen to much music . i love reading fiction books . especially sci fi and horror books . oh ok . i love rock music . its so awesome and raw . what is your favorite rock band ? i am really into this band called avatar right now . they are from sweden . hat is an interesting band . i may have to look them up .
yeah ! i have been staying in reading to my two cats . they love it ! i love cats and all animals . i have a lizard , bird , dog , and fish
He is and Leonardo DiCaprio is a great actor Love Leonardo Dicaprio. He was excellent in this movie, such a good fit Agreed and casting Margot Robbie as his wife was the perfect pairing Oh yes she is great as well I'm surprised at some of the responses, though. Some of the responses in here? No, the critic responses. I see that it got a C CinemaScore. Some people said the characters were dull. I didn't find that to be true Oh, I see.  Rotten Tomatoes is known to be very tough on it's critique.    I think the critical reposes forget that the scope of the movie was fairly narrow because they had to take a story and condense into a few hours. Yes, you are right about that. A lot of times, Rotten Tomatoes does get it wrong. It was a tough movie to direct i'm sure I am interested in Penny Stocks, so I thought this movie had a good premise of what Penny Stocks are and how they can cause some serious damage Yes, especially when left unregulated. Yes, absolutely! Jonah Hill is a great actor as well Agreed.  I am so use to seeing him in comedy roles, it was refreshing see him play this role. Yes.. I don't think anyone thought he could pull that off, haha Things on Wall Street are pretty similar today. Everyone is out to make money for themselves It will always be that way.  I think a lot of people could relate to the movie.  its why it made it wildly successful Yes, I think you're right about that Leo definitely should of won an Oscar for this one Not saying they can relate to Jordan Belfort.  He was a outlier.  He made lots of illegal trades.  Got caught up in the drugs an alcohol scene.  But the industry and the riches that can potentially come with it Absolutely! The illegal trading aspect of it isn't great. But I feel like there are so many people who do the same thing. Especially with the drugs and alcohol. I'm sure a ton of Wall Streeters live that exact lifestyle

well dang, maybe the second bad dude is the top villain. So how does Gru pull off stealing the moon all by himself? It is somehow about Gru attempting to get the financing for his big scheme and how he makes a rival out of the other guy which turns out to be Vector, the character voiced by Jason Segal He ends up having to steal a shrink ray in order to get the money ok so vector is the other bad guy. why doesnt Gru just go to a bank and get a loan? Or ask some friends for the money?

Yeah, at least we know how it works on the evil villain side of things. How was the quality of jokes to you? I thought they were pretty solid for the kids and adults. They were alright, not great but good for everyone to laugh at I think. How did you like the personalities of the three girls?
ope it is just me and my corvette ice ! i do have love a good political conversation so sometimes we argue . does that make your husband feel self conscious ?
It must be a good movie if they are making a second one.  I will have to watch the first one for sure.
I have it seen only once What did you think about the story? The life of Mark Zuckerberg played by Jesse Elsenberg is really interesting and shocking at the same time. Do you think Jesse Elsenberg did a good job on this film? Yes, I believe Jesse Eisenberg did a great job portraying Mark Zuckerberg I think the film deserves its 96% rating of Rotten Tomatoes Yes I believe the film was entertaining and well made. I always enjoy films based on real people or real events. What did you think about the lawsuits that Mark Zuckerburg went through? I thought it was very interesting to see the legal battles that are created that startups deal with Small details that seem trivial can be just enough to tip the odds in your favor to win a lawsuit do you think it was righteous the outcome? This is a story of how someone that does something wrong, ends up the hero and filthy successful, is that right do you think?
i have no emotions like computers .
very nice ! i am really hoping to be a published author one day
I forgot amy adams was in there I thought the scene where He is cornered by Carl,who insists that Frank will return to the FBI job since no one is chasing him. Was actually quiet moving and a big turning moment for Mr. Abagandale. Amy Adams is wonderful I also think Tom Hanks as Carl Hanratty is very believable he was awesome I think i may watch the movie again Yes you already told me that in formation I apologize I got confused lol yes I will too I generally don't like DiCapprio movies but this one was good Really? I think he has matured a lot as an actor I agree with that.

How were the critics responses? and it has pretty good critic responces one of the best is´´Despicable Me is a 3D cartoon comedy of whisplash-quick laughs, funny punch lines and a wickedly gimmicky appreciation for 3D´´ and then the rest are also positive That sounds great. What is the plot about? another interesting point is that it has a CinemaScore of A the plot is about a supervillain (Gru) that is very mean at first he then adopts three girls that change his life and he becomes a better person and a hero actually Cool That is interesting Yeah! it is pretty interesting watch it! you wont regret it I am interested in this movie, thanks!
Hello So the movie I got was Iron Man. You should watch it for Robert Downey Jr. I've heard good things, what's it about? Its about  an genius industrialist that builds a powered exoskeleton and becomes a superhero called Iron Man. That sounds cool, so is it an action movie? Yes. It is essentially an action superhero movie. It looks like it got a 94% score from Rotten Tomatoes and a Cinema Score of an A They are good scores. Do you know who else is in the movie? Gwyneth Paltrow is in it. Also Jeff Bridges and Terrence Howard star in the movie, with Bridges being the villain and Howard being a friend of Tony Stark Cool, i like those actors, who directed it? A director names Jon Favreau. There seems to be a lot of positive reviews like how one critic said that the movie was a  "expansively entertaining special effects extravaganza" with " fresh energy and stylistic polish" Wow that's a good review! So the movie has great actors and special effects, do you know anything about the music? i'm very interested in film scores Actually I don't know about the film score but since it was produced by the Marvel Studios and from the great review scores, we can safely assume that the film score is fantastic. That's good news, i enjoy the other Marvel movies When you watch the Iron Movie, I really enjoyed the scene in which Tony Stark was imprisoned in a cave by a terrorist group and was injured heavily. So his fellow captive scientist implants a very cool looking electromagnet into Stark's chest. Do you normally like movies with lots of special effects? That sounds like an exciting scene. I do enjoy movies with special effects, and i'm a big fan of most Marvel films

What state does this take place in? What time of year does it take place in? This takes place in South Carolina. The main character, Noah falls in love with a 17 year old heiress named Allie. They have a summer love affair. How romantic! Do they continue their relationship after summer or do the end their relationship! Is there tragedy in the movie? Allie is prevented by her parents from seeing Noah further. The two get in an argument and break up. How sad! There must be a twist in the movie?? What was the reason that the parents would not let them see each other? Allie's family ends up moving to Charleston. Allie's parents call Noah trash. Overall the critics say the movie is good for people craving over-the-top romance. It does have rather low ratings overall though. I see! There must have been some type of "class" difference. Or was it that Noah was truly "trash"? How long is the movie? I'm not sure. I do know though that Noah wrote letters to Allie daily for a year but Allie's mother intercepted them. Noah enlists in WWII and Allie becomes engaged to another man.
Saito ending up in limbo does not sound like a fun time.  Such a complicated world, or dreams... Being in limbo is a scary concept too. And it sounds like an interesting concept to have armed projections in your head to protect you against this type of thing. Would be interesting to have someone in another person's dreams.  It's unchartered territory. Funny to see the military technology to get into the dream world.  Scary concept too. DiCaprio as usual did a fantastic job in the movie.
Cool.  Is this movie appropriate for teens?
i do especially when i volunteer at the shelter i enjoy driving as well , especially in my purple mustang i love the color pink but i bet purple mustang is beautiful
YEAH VERY NICE KRISHOFF OAKEN The animated, 3-D adventure wants to enliven and subvert the conventions of typical Disney princess movies while simultaneously remaining true to their aesthetic trappings for maximum merchandising potential. It all seems so cynical, this attempt to shake things up without shaking them up too much. "Frozen" just happens to be reaching theaters as Thanksgiving and the holiday shopping season are arriving. The marketing possibilities are mind-boggling. And in the tradition of the superior When they were young girls, sisters Anna and Elsa were joyous playmates and inseparable friends. But Elsa's special power—her ability to turn anything to ice and snow in a flash from her fingertips—comes back to haunt her when she accidentally zaps her sister. OK BYE OK BYEEEEEEEEEEE WHICH YEAR FROZEN MOVIE STARTED? 2013 AMERICAN 3D COMPUTER ANIMATED MUSICAL FANTASY FLIM PRODUCED BY WALT DISNEY. WHILE IT LAGS THE TINIEST BIT ON ITS WAY TO THE CONCLUSION. JONATHAN GROFF AS KRISTOFF YES ELSA TURNS TWENTY ONE SHE IS TO BE CROWNED QUEEN OF ARENDELLE. WHAT WAS THE PRINCESS AGE? THE KING AND QUEEN ISOLATE BOTH SISTERS WITHIN THE CASTLE.
Does it have a sad or happy ending? Oh, totally happy. It's a Disney movie! Ok, good. I hate sad endings. Oh, Disney! Now I am even more perplexed as to how I missed it. Yea, gets excellent reviews too. 100% for Rotten Tomatoes Is it more for girls or boys you think? Very original when it came out Both I think I might watch it with my niece. How does it compare to Disney movies now? Since it is so old. Same kind of story.. the animation is 1995-esque haha I wouldnt call the music as popular, this isnt in the document, but Randy Newmans "youve got a friend in me" is featured That is a cute song in my opinion. but I ususally have a different opinion than others I take it there is some action in this movie as well A little bit, mostly involving flying around, not in an exaggarted super hero way though Is there a "bad guy" typically there is! Oh yea What kind
How are you? Hello I'm doing good. What is the movie called? A classic you have got to guess. It has a real hot shower scene. Ahh there are a lot of movies with hot shower scenes It's from the early 90s that could be difficult
Certainly, and the synopsis for the movie sounds really good However, seeking vengeance for a car and a puppy isn't very motivating to me how about you The car, no. The puppy, Yes! Reeves is good in these type movies. I read he is an ex-hitman in this movie. Maybe if someone killed his wife then it would make more sense to me, here she is recently deceased not murdered Pets do matter but I'm not going to go hitman on people for it Reeves is very good at these types of movies True. I think the overall theme is vengeance.  I find it difficult to comprehend that this is going to be a movies with several sequels. It also appears to be a quite violent movie. You're right the plot in my opinion could have been much deeper.
yes but a good watch to really understand, thank you
what do you do for work ? i clean up after people . not great but it pays the bills yeah we do what we have to sometimes .

i live in a city , but not a big one . re you single , i am but would like to get married someday .
yes. that's a  solid list of characters It's got the tag of being the best Disney animated feature since Beauty and the Beast sounds like its interesting that too Cast and script look water tight too I bet the kids loved the 3D aspect of the movie definitely what else do you know about it? It says it was inspired by Hans Christian Anderson's fairy tale, "The Snow Queen" oh cool So it's like a retake on an old classic Yeah, seems like it Ok, nice chatting A story of two sisters... both very different form each other yeah Likewise

It went pretty well for the critics, too. When I think about it, I even liked Rex the most. Said it was "a work of genius" Which, for the time, is accurate I didn't like the boy. Sid Andy Davis. He was an interesting antagonist Oh Why not? He just felt to childish for me. Maybe that is okay as he is 6, but I just didn't like him. I liked Sarge So, yes. I guess I liked the antagonist sid more. Yes, Sarge is a good man. Great soldier and leader I wonder if its the same Steve Jobs from Apple? A green soldier. So christimas day is when they got a new house...thats cool Sid & Scud...what a named duo
Oh ok, thats the one where its some old boys doing a pub crawl in an end of days type scenario? Nope nope this takes place back in ww2 dureing the evacuation of Dunkirk are there any actors in the movie I might know? I was really impressed by it because it is not a talky kind of movie. Some people you may know are in it Harry Syles from one of the british boy bands hmmm, no I've never heard of that fella.  Are there any gorgeous women in it? But he is not a lead the whole story is about this young army private Named Tommy played by FIONN WHITEHEAD what really draws me into a movie, is some full frontal from a pretty, young thing.  I guess war movies can be ok too. Yea its more a war movie no real love interests. LOL.  on a scale of 1-10, what would you score it? 1 being bad and 10 being Great Its the story about Tommy trying to get out of dunkirk dureing an ambush I would give it a solid 6 beacuse I am not a HUGE war movie fan... but I was really into the Beautiful cinimatography and directing By Christopher Nolan
well, of all the spielberg movies, this one probably ranks low in my book, if you ask me. but theni'm not too big on biographies I would agree, I think this is probably low in terms of the quality of a Spielberg movies, but I really like history a lot so I would probably watch this.  But I probably wouldn't watch it in the theatre, I would cross my fingers and hope it's on Netflix it should be on netflix now. are you from the US? it's been out for over 16 years Yeah I am.  I am surprised this got such good ratings for a film that seems like it's not one of Spielberg's best it's an interesting life of a fraud who turned FBI informant of a sort. but still i think it could've been made much better. i didn't like dicaprio in the movie it wasn't believable Ha!  I don't like him either, he is not a draw to get me to see a movie.  I'm not a huge fan of his i think he's so overrated.tom hanks was great in it I do love Tom Hanks - I will see anything that he is in.  I think DiCaprio is overrated too.  But Christopher Walken is good, and Amy Adams is good, this was made before she really got popular the thing is that abagnale could've actually become a lawyer on his own. as far as ai recall he actually passed the bar, i think It's interesting he did most of his cons before he was 19.  You have to wonder if anyone would be able to get away with that today.  Although if he pulled all that off when he was a teenager he must have been really intelligent.
hank i am inspired by alexander mcqueen and the great coco chanel i am also obsessed with makeup hat is good i moved to new york just to study in a prestigious designing school
do you watch any sports ? yes but i only really watch hockey ice , what do you like about it ? i prefer watching soccer games , i am really into it . it is just really entertaining to watch to be honest s long as youre having fun , it does not matter rue , very true , so what are you doing ? looking online for some new shoes . are you up to anything ?
I have not seen Wonder Woman yet, I am typically not a fan of superhero films. But the story does look very interesting. It's supposed to be very good.  Gal Godot did a great job, and the critics are giving it great reviews. It does have solid reviews, from what I did see. I didn't like how the other DC movies were so dark and grim.  Wonder Woman did a good job staying truer to how the comics started. Which DC movies have a dark and grim tone? Pretty much all of the other movies based on the DC universe. I see. That is not necessarily a bad thing, but it is good to see that this movie took a different angle. Yeah.  It was alot more fun than the others.  Not so serious, but with a lot of action. It is a war movie, but it is not serious? Sounds sort of contradictory, do you agree? Sort of.  It's not exactly a war movie, it's a comic book story thats set mostly in the time of World War 1. oh, that makes much more sense then. Sorry for the confusion. No problem.  The part during World War 1 is only part of the story.  It then fast forwards to present day times

I asked if the Snow Queen was evil. Or who is she? Yes What else? The two sisters in the plot were Elsa and Anna Are they really close in the movie? Elsa happens to accidentally injure Anna while they both were playing in the childhood She injured her with her magical powers What powers? cryokinetic magic Does Anna have powers as well? Then their parents took both of them to a colony led by Grand Pabbie where he heals Anna Nope But while healing, he removes her memories about Elsa's powers Is there a reason why? So that Anna doesn't know that her sister had harmed her probably Oh king and queen isolate both of them for their safety within the castle while both become teens, their parents die during a storm That's sad. Now when Elsa turns 21, she was going to be crowned as queen but she had a fear in her mind About her sister? that people might find out about her powers Ohh. I figured she would just tell people about them later, when she's older or trained. The castle opens up for coronation ceremony wherein Duke and a prince from Southern Isles comes to attend the ceremony Are they nice? Prince Hans and Anna fall in love and Hans proposes to Anna Yea Oooh. But Elsa objects to this and shows her powers
Hi Hi there.... What did you think of this movie? I love the actors or at least voices...haha I love the actors too haha I've never seen the movie tho me neither... just clips Yeah I'm going to have to watch it with my kids tho. the ratings are awesome I know. Until an earlier discussion I never knew it had 2 sequals Buzz Lightyear apparently discovers that he is a toy... that could be a funny scene! especially voiced by Tim Allen... Definitely espionage via baby monitors by the toys... that has got to interesting I didn't know that this was the director's first film... great job! Using the baby monitors lol I didn't either. He got it right the first time apparently
Have you ever seen Home Alone, a 1990 comedy film about a boy who is left behind when his family flies to Paris?
I usually agree with Rotten Tomatoes Scores. I am not familiar with CinemaScore It's a matter of personal taste, I guess.  If you like the idea of fighting robots, this movie's for you!

It certainly is. I appreciate that there are positive and negative reviews in the document Yes, it is great to see a variety of opinions. Do you know what CinemaScope is?

Have you seen this movie? I saw it a long time ago but do not remember it well. You? I also watched it a long time ago It was cute. It was. Mostly what I remember is that it introduced the minions that everyone is so obsessed about. That's all I really remember too I didn't know it was directed by people who had never directed a movie before. That's interesting. I thought it was great how all the minions had to work together It is! And it was so popular too Very popular. I do love Steve Carrell, I feel like I should go rewatch it. I forgot they stole the moon Oh my, and Vector And the Great Pyramid of Giza. He is a funny character Jason Segel is very funny. I guess I didn't realize Russell Brand was in this. I didn't either I need to rewatch this too I wonder why it only got a 6.8/10. I don't even love animation but it's cute.

I could see where they would mean a dark comedy... Although I'm not sure how funny Wall Street corruption is Yeah, apparently critics say it was pretty dull. It got decent rotten tomato scores, but I don't think it's as funny as they tried to make it seem If the critics say that it was dull than I'm scared to watch it, typically they enjoy dull

So how did he overcome his enemies? He was going to kill the person that murdered his parent when he was set free but someone else got to him first. Who? Bruce then went to train to become Batman. Chill is who murdered his parents. An assassin on Carmine Falcone killed him Chill?  I never heard of that enemy. He's basically Bruce's first enemy since he's the one who killed his parents. Ok.

yes and it got 92% on rotten tomatoes The lady custodian falls in love with a human amphibiod, interesting! do you usually watch movies based on the ratings ? No you? sometimes
Yeah, it has pretty good scores. Rotten tomatoes gave it a 79% Yeah. For a comedy-animation film, they did a good job making it a funny squeal with good animation. Yeah, Billy Crystal and John Goodman have great chemistry Yeah. They do and Dan Scanlon did a good job directing it as well. Yeah, I agree. It's true to the spirit of the original Monsters Inc., but it still feels new Yeah. It is a cute movie that is funny and has colorful animation. Mike Wazowski is so cute as a little monster, I love that they showed his journey Yeah. I like how you get to see how he met his friend Sulley.
It is about robots who are used to simulate boxing matches. Imagine Rocky meets Transformers sounds like an interesting concept, who is the main actor The main actor is Hugh Jackman, known for playing Wolverine. where is the setting It doesnt specifically say but, from context, I believe the near future in the US is there any clue about which side is good or bad Jackman's character seems to be on the Good side is he the one designing the robots for these fights I'm not sure. I remember a trailer for this movie and he acted as a sort of trainer/ manager for the robots is there any indication about the types of weapons that the robots are using or are they just punching each other They only punch, no major "weapons" is there a love story or some other unrelated to the fighting type of plot The humans in the movie has their own sub plot but Jackman's character (Charlie) does not begin with a clear love interest are the fights similar to a boxing match where there would be people watching and cheering for a fan favorite, or are they fighting in random places throughout the city They take place in an arena so there are people watching in a set space is there a robot that is considered the champion There is one named Zeus who is considered the Global Champion so that one would be like Apollo Creed in Rocky Exactly. Jackman's character Charlie operates a robot called Atom who is the underdog

Makes you want to cheer little bunny Judy on! This document describes the remainder of the movie including the antagonist. There are too many people in this world that do things to hurt others and l believe that movies like this help to deter that. this one talks about night howlers Mine is still about Zootopia What is night owl about Night howlers it just changed again to what seems like a description of the middle of zootopia Do you find this confusing as to what they are wanting? It states that there are animals who go savage Yes. Very!!! It states that one of the charaters were bullied.

I will take your word for it then! What did you love most about it? The plot is about Nick Carraway moving next door to Jay Gatsby and the love interest that springs up between Gatsby and Daisy Buchanan. I am a sap for most romantic movies to be honest hahaha and this is the perfect story for it! Are Daisy and Nick related in anyway? Yes they actually are! Daisy is Nick's cousin! LOL! I'll have to check out more romance movies because of your suggestions. Daisy is married to a man named Tom Buchanan, who happens to be an incredibly wealthy man. Ah, okay. I was wondering how Jay found Daisy. It's so convenient to fall in love with your best friends cousin, LOL. Does Daisy end up falling in love with Jay? HAHA incredibly convenient. And yes, Daisy does end up falling in love with Jay... but it is a much more.....tragic....story hahaha Wow, sounds like a pretty interesting movie then.What's tragic about it? That Gatsby is murdered at the end of the film by a man who's wife was murdered by Daisy. Spoiler alert
i see . my favorite soundtrack is the crow . what are your other hobbies ? i smoke pot from time to time hat is a good hobby . haha
Yes, Steve Carrell plays Gru a mean supervillain, Jason Segel as Victor "Vector" Perkins Mr. Perkins' son and Gru's archenemy, and Russell Brand as Dr. Nefario Gru's elderly gadget man and a friendly scientist. It is hilarious with great voices from awesome actors and actress. what is the plot of the movie? Despicable Me is a 3D cartoon comedy of whiplash-quick laughs, funny punch lines and a wickedly gimmicky appreciation for 3D.
hat is so cool ! we are on opposite sides of the country yeah . i will see your airport though when i layover on my vacation next month .
Fifty years I think
The tragic ending where Myrtle's husband George shoots Gatsby , and then himself was a classic ending That was such a twist! I never saw it coming did you?

What year does it take place in? the film takes place in 1963 and all throughout the 60's Is it a violent film? What age range do you think it would suite? not really violent if i were to rate it id say pg-13 Makes sense if he did all this before he was 18! Anything else you find interesting about it? i find it very interesting that this film is based on a true story. Do you know any of the actors in it? yes, the main character is Leonardo DiCaprio as frank abagnale jr. Oh wow.

I thought that was a unique approach, too. How do you account for its poor ratings on Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic? Do you think it could happen in reality? No, not at all.  And that's what makes it a fun concept to explore. God would never allow a man to have those kind of powers, and rightfully so. However, it makes a fun allegory. It is inexplicable the low grades, it seems very good I think the same, god would not give power to a simple mortal, it is a lot of power
i am doing great . anything interesting with you ? yes . so my favorite band was toto and i named my dog toto . rip jeff porcaro he was an awesome drummer . oh . i am so sorry he died . it was a long time ago . anyway , i just got back from the mall . oh . what did you buy ? othing for me , but i helped my daughters pick out stuff , which i love to do .

Haha! Regina is a wicked girl! She sounds very...mean lol :p
we do not always get meat either . too expensive for six kids . pasta is cheap . six kids wow ! a vegetarian lifestyle certainly is less expensive . we grow our own so it is even cheaper . i do not know what the future brings . or do i . hopefully the bartending will pick up again soon .

little bit of both i love onions but never cooked i work too much you know ? you should quit and sail the seas yes i need to travel more
It is. A definite knockout result. Some people think it's just delusional hype I found the last review listed to be very clever. The bit about the movie being a metaphor for itself. It definitely translates to real life and makes the events seem relatable. Almost makes the movie seem more like a horror movie to me, because it can be scary to think what might happen if the wrong idea gets planted in the wrong mind. That's a good point Do you like Leonardo DiCaprio? I like him well enough.  He seems to be a good actor. Based on the scene described, it sounds a lot like The Matrix. He is. I defintely agree. It was interesting to digest. Definitely an in your head piece. The "kick" bit doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me.  I guess I would need to see the movie to fully understand. Oh wow, this new scene is pretty intense. I know, it's very intense. Did you see the reviews it got? Just the ones listed.  I don't pay much attention to movie reviews.  It looks like they were fairly mixed. Though the IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes ratings seem to suggest people really liked the movie. I was surprised that the reviews were so high. The movie definitely had a cult like following. I'm guessing this last scene is the ending of the movie? I think so Do you know who else was in the movie? It said Ellen Page is. And Joseph Gordon Levitt Oh, cool. I like Joseph Gordon Levitt. I am curious what Fischer ends up doing with the advice the team planted in his mind.
so what do you do for a living ? i am a writer . i write romance novels and erotic fiction .
Hello! Hello! Do you like super hero movies? I absolutely love them! Spider-man? So you will love this one! It's Batman Begins movie, directed by Christopher Nolan, did you watched? did you watch, you mean? Yeah! I love that movie. Do you like it? Yes! The cast is incredible, Christian Bale is really good in Bruce Wayne's role Arguably the second-best Batman cast ever. Bale is my favorite Batman. I agree Who else do you enjoy in the film? The Scarecrow is also very good Really? What do you like about him? His ability to "poison" Batman, giving him nightmares of his childhood and his parents death The movie is also great to show his childhood, when he felt into the dry well full of bats, which developed his phobia Oh yeah. That's really intense stuff. I definitely enjoy the film. Yeah, I know. It has 84% of approvement in Rotten Tomatoes. It is a very good rating for a super hero movie That's a great percentage. Do you think Rotten Tomatoes is a creditable resource? I think it's a good place to get the critics from a movie. But I don't trust them 100%, I just use it to give an idea of how good the movie might be That's the same way I use RT. That's great. What do you think about Batman's trainning scene in the League of Shadows? I think it's the best part. The way Liam portrays Ra's is amazing. Definitely agree. Liam fits so well Ra's character Exactly. It's ridiculous how well he takes on that mantle. I personally find him better than Scarecrow. And what about the trial scene? I liked that a lot also I do not remember the trial scene perfectly, could you describe it to me? It's been a long time since I watched too, but I remember them walking on thin ice Ah okay I believe I remember now. What else do you like? the scenes from the Arkham Asylum, when Falcone is sent there after been poisoned by the Scarecrow
i am okay , i work from home on the internet , but my dog has been acting crazy is your dog doing okay ? yeah , just behavioral issues . i cannot wait for my husband to come home . what does your husband do for a living ? he is a manager of a guitar store hat is very cool . i am a professional baker yea it is . i enjoy playing guitar . being a baker must be a lot of fun . it is . i love cake . i also love to play tennis is is hard . . . i can only play it in video games , which i love too . video games are fun . i like the show silicon valley oh , my husband and i watch that show , it is very good . i like to watch it with my sisters oh how many sisters do you have ?

I would say it's been almost two years. If you were to give me a reason to watch this movie, what would it be? If you're looking for a wholesome family movie that's safe for the kids to watch and is overall enjoyable, it would be a good choice.
That's very true.
it is difficult but a mom has to do what a mom has to do

Yea that was a funny part and I liked how she had the recorder in her carrot pen. I am not suprised that i liked it, i generally like films by Rich moore. That was the first time I had watched a movie by him. i thought he and Byron howard did a really great job! They really did and there was deeper message in it as well. Not only was it a kids movie but it taught kids not to judge people by their appearances. It's always nice when a cartoon can be entertaining as well as teach valuable lessons. Yes it had a great lesson that was learned and a great movie overall.
o studying in nutrition . what do you drive ? i drive a 98 jaguar xj8 . i love things like look old fashioned . you ? i do not drive any more 2 crashes , and antiques are awesome . re you okay after those crashes ?

No i would not say that but maybe for older people or europeans Fair point. What would you describe it as? i would say its an action movie Defiantly action. Did you agree with the rating and review it had? 92% Rotten Tomatoes that seems about right i don't think it will win best picture Any best actors you think will get an award? no i don't think any were particularly memorable the big booms were the real star What about Tom Glynn-Carney? Mr Dawson's son. I don't recall any names really was he on the small boat? Was he in the group that joined the Scottish soldiers and hid inside the trawler until the tide rose? I might be thinking of Gibson.
hat is the last genre i would think a librarian would be into . kudos to you ! , yeah i am weird . so , have any hobbies ? i like bird watching . his is strange , but i love potatoes . i host a potatoe growing contest . hat is strange , lol . i prefer simple things like hot dogs and pepsi .

I never noticed. Must be a very good actor. Well, if you look at the document, he played both Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss. Do you think Mark Zuckerberg really behaved like the actor in the movie? Jesse Eisenberg did a good job of playing the brilliant hero, Founder Mark Zuckerberg.  I thought it was exciting and instinctivly perceptive.

You should go see Leonardo DiCaprio and Joel Edgerton in the Great Gatsby! The movie is Baz Luhrmann's interpretation of the F Scott Fitzgerald novel of the same name Is it a historical time piece movie? What is the name of the movie? The movie is The Great Gatsby! It is Not really a time piece -- it is a romantic drama set in the Roaring 20's in New York State. The movie follows the life and times of millionaire Jay Gatsby Who plays the female lead? Carey Mulligan plays Daisy Buchanan -- she is the female lead. Did it win any awards? Are you still there? Yes. Did the movie win any awards? No, it wasn't an award winner. Your best bet it to put aside any literary agenda you are tempted to bring with you and you'll enjoy the movie more that way. Are there any other famous actors in it besides Carey Mulligan and Leonardo DiCaprio? The movie also stars Tobey Maguire as Nick Carraway and Emily Foreman as Pammy Buchanan. The other remaining star is Joel Edgerton, as I already mentioned Is there any violence in the movie? What rating is the movie? I'm not sure about that, but did you know the the story centers around Nick Carraway's trip to stay at the small cottage beside his cousin Daisy Buchanan's home? It is set in the 20's and follows the life of Jay Gatsby What rating is the movie?
pancakes are one of my very favorites i am not vegan . vegan is actually very good tasting and healthy

Yes and when they first expanded facebook, it was to other ivy league schools. Yea it was pretty much a closed community. I think they were building a community of like minded people.

HI, there!  I'm looking for a movie to see -- or one to avoid! -- do you have any thougths? Have you seen Despicable Me? I haven't! Who's in it? Who directed it? Pierre Colffin and Chris Renaud are the directors.  Steve, Carrell, Jason Segel and Russel Brand Hmmmm.  Steve Carrell and Russell Brand are interesting. What's it about? It's a computer-animated comedy. Has a super villain archenemy, and a scientist Hmmmm....I don't generally like those. Anything especially interesting in the general plot line? Not that I am aware of. It's a debut film from Universal Pictures and Illumination Entertainment. Probably just a good cartoon is what it looks like. Well, it could be interesting. What were the reviews like? The reviews were good, laughs and funny, kids and adults.  So looks like it is good for all ages. Any other info on the plot? A supervillian is sad when another supervillian steals the Great Pyramid of Giza (he had been thinking of doing that).  The supervillian then decides to steal the moon. Then a rivalry starts between the two That sounds fun! I love the idea of stealing the Great Pyramid. I wonder where you stash that thing! The moon, too.  I love the moon. Anything else? Looks like Gru, the main character refers to himself by Gru,  I always think that's funny when they do that. I often refer to myself as Gru. I can identify. What is the supervillan's name? Gru is the supervillan and Vector is his archenemy Ah!  Gru is the bad guy, then. Vector, the scientist of course, is the good guy. What does he aim to do to recover the pyramids and prevent the theft of the moon? Gru steals a shrink ray to get money for a loan. Looks like some little kids are involved and Gru starts to have feelings for them.  They are from an orphanage.  Then we have the battle of good vs. evil internally- watch the kids at a recital or steal the moon.

I am not sure, but did you know that Facebook was originally called Facemash? That I did not know Also, Zuckerberg was inspired to create the site after being dumped by his now ex-girlfriend. That I had heard Isn't it impressive that facebook spread from one ivy league school to another? Are you human? Its very impressive and yes It was interesting that the company moved all the way to Palo Alto. Are they monitoring this conversation? Yeah, to make sure we are on the right topic lol Just making sure. It seems that Sean Parker had a lot of help in forming what Facebook is today. Yes thats true. Who says " Facebook me" is still in use today. More so over "text me" Yeah definitely today, but back in the early 2000's smartphone technology was inferior to what it is today. Especially in 2003 when Facebook was just starting up. thats so true and back then it was about MySpace Exactly But Facebook did fly quickly when it caught on

I forgot that they were going to go to Paris as their trip I just thought they were going to like California or something I had forgotten more than I remembered about the movie it's always funny and fun to watch in this movie, they family forgets to take him It is I like McAuley Culkin younger work  he did really funny and good job for somebody that young the mom realizes after they have boarded the plane Yeah once I get to Paris they realize they forgot them yes, his acting was really good Wel midflight because I can’t really do anything to the land I think weather prevented them from getting back as quickly as possible to him

I want to say they did (?), how do you think you would have felt if you were in Kevin's position and you just got outright left by your family for vacation? Not only that why didn't they just come back for their 8 year old? Agree - that was harsh, I would have been angry but he seemed to be glad for a while - eating whatever he wanted.

What is the animation like? Is it hand drawn like the old animated films? It is computer animated, but it is produced by disney. Ohhhhhhh Disney, I love what they do with animation. Computer animated, early days indeed, does it look good? Though it is older, the animation really does look great. What they chose to animate looks wonderful, and they didnt do anything that looks to bad compared to todays standards
Yes I love Tom hanks Have you seen movies about news paper companies before? Only one.  "It's a wonderful Life" What about movies about the Vietnam war?
I don't know that I like that Judy blackmails Nick though I mean, he is a conman so it isn't like he doesn't work the system to get what he needs. But yes. Blackmail isn't very nice. Agree, blackmail isn't the appropriate way to get what you want. However, at least Judy learns that Nick had a hard life They come together and it really highlights the inclusive nature that the film is going for. Yes, I like that Judy saves Nick. It's nice to see a strong female character. And despite her blackmailing him, he stands up to Chief Bogo for her which is also nice. it's sad that Judy ends up quitting her job though Yes. Also that she upsets everyone with her talk about predatory biology. worse that she ends up upsetting Nick with her comments, after they became friends

I try to, but I more read Rotten Tomatoes. Is Metacritic an aggregator type service, too. Yes it is. And not to mention Rotten Tomatoes gave this move a 91%. Looks like the aggregator you read gave this movie a high rating as well Cool. I think I remember this won some Oscars? Yes I believe so too. The performance of Benedict Cumberbatch as Alan Turing was phenomenal Oh wow. I feel like from 2014-15 Cumberbatch was in everything. But he's such a versatile performer that it's always nice to see him. Yes, even The Hollywood Reporter stated Cumberbatch was the highlight of the film with his charisma and his potraying of physical oddness was true talent That's high praise from them, they can be vicious when they want to be. Do you like period movies or more modern ones?

On rotten tomatoes it has a 100% fresh rating and Cinema Score gave it an A. I would say that means it's pretty good. I understand, but did you watch it and form your own opinion.  I mean 100% just means a lot of critics liked it more than disliked it.  It doesn't mean critics thought it was one of the best of all time, you know. Need a human for that. One of the best scenes is when Buzz is first introduced to the characters. It's pretty funny that he thinks he's an actual space ranger.
yes it is , whats up ? okay . just finished dinner . . . . third time i had steak in the last week ! what did not you understand ? i am curious . steak is bad lol i did not know what you meant by i like jokes , but maybe it was just a comment ? it was its something i like oh i see . i guess i like jokes too ! lol in moderation some are over the top ugh lol

TRUMP! Haha alright :) Was making sure you're real hahah OMG, really! Haha yes, I do a lot of these and sometimes they have robots talking - they have improved over the years. You don't believe in true love, huh!?! Lol, yeah they have Well, yes sometimes but at times people have to go their own ways in life What did you like/ dislike about the movie? doesn't mean we don't love them heh Well, to be honest I'm not a huge romance guy :) But I liked the chemistry between the two people I get that, not too many guys are. Allie and Noah Haha :) But also I thought that the cinematography was amazing I did too. One of my favorite parts is when they are at the ocean and Noah asks Allie what she is and she says, I'm a bird. Lol! And he says back, well, If you're a bird I'm a bird too! Ahh, now that is how you know someone loves you Hahah, the dialogue in the film makes it Lol!! It does, so romantic! I need to rewatch it :), I think I'll try to stream it later Does your husband like it? I think he tolerates it for me. Now I want to rewatch it too! Lol
oh goodness . i am sorry . do not be sorry for me ! i drive a jaguar ! woohoo . i graduated college a few yrs back maybe before long i can afford one
hat good anyway how are you today ?
But what about Morgan Freeman as God? Who doesn't love Morgan Freeman lol I think Morgan being God was to add to the humor but I don't know for me it still fell flat. I mean, he basically is god so... fit into the role well It was probably the only funny part to me Lol agree haha! Rotten Tomatoes gave it a 48% and Metacritic scored it a 46/100 ouch! What did you think about the story line? I think the common folk thought it was more entertaining than the critics I mean... it's a pretty silly set up to start with it Bruce suffered from so much bad luck throughout the movie it's hard to take it seriously. I mean who honestly has that much bad luck lol Do you think he had good intentions playing God? I think so and in all honestly they depicted God in a good way. It gives you a idea of what God is like answering prayers day in and day out and Bruce could not handle that much responsibility as it was driving him nuts. I mean, he is only human.. ha. I think it was a pretty inoffensive, humorous take on God/people's relationships
, so does my husband . not my thing . i like movies or reading book series .
really that is bad . i like reading real crime books oh crime is awful . yuck really . but i love them . i love drinking caramel cappuccino . oh that is really good ! i do not like other women
The musician joins a band and they go on tour. The two main characters get in a fight where she accuses him of abandoning his dreams. She leaves feeling insulted, frustrated. He ends up missing her play due to band photo shoot that he had forgotten about. The play is bad and hardly anyone attends. He attempts to apologize for missing the play but she is unwilling to forgive him and terminates their relationship and she moves back to her hometown. man, that doesn't sound so romantic! i can definitely see the drama part. Is there good music in the movie? parts romantic, parts dramatic yes, there is. jazz music. he plays the piano I do enjoy piano. Any singing?
I do wonder why it's considered an American historical drama when it's based on a British person. I like how the one critic is surprised that a Hollywood movie exaggerated some things. Like what a shock! I guess because it was made in America? I think they have to exaggerate to make it interesting enough to keep people in seats for two or more hours. Yeah exactly. To keep it interesting. I guess I was questioning how they made it sound like it's American history. So it's also kind of sort of a love story. Now I'm even more curious after reading about his crush. That is how they made it sound. I was thinking the same thing. The enigma machine sounds dreadful and exciting. I assume that wrote the codes for them. Anything called an Enigma machine has to be pretty cool. Even if it's Nazis who are using it.
i like kids as long as they stay on the other side of the room .
yes ! being an rn i love people its a god given gift . hat is awesome ! what do you like to do ? i love to read books on cooking since becoming a vegan i find it helps me can vegan recipes use honey ? i love it ! i do not use it but i have friends that do
hello my hobby is to sleep all day wow i am 2nd generation from greece
i remember those days
No there isn't!!! And I just noticed that Tina Fey's name is at the bottom, duh. Soooooo I guess my next question is do you agree with the rating? I feel like I mostly do, it surprised me for the genre It's not a genre I'm really into. If I watch a teen movie it's probably one where they are being chased by a giant prehistoric alligator. HAHA I like horror too even though that's way off topic and action and a little comedy and family because I have a small child! Back on topic, lol, have you heard of the director or do you have an opinion of him?
i am a nerd , lots of computer stuff i can handle that , i accept you for who you are hanks , what about you ? i sing and write poems , you can wake up one day and find one by your side really ? what kind of poems ? love poems , humorous ones , some telling how beautiful you are hat is too funny , oh man what do you find so funny about it , my future love ? well i am wondering if you are a woman , first of all yes , i am a woman but my characters a man so lol men do not usually speak about poems or talk so smoothly . i am guessing i have done a horrible job of impersonating a man hat is a good thing ,
It's a comedy. Tina Fey wrote the screenplay. Oh Lindsey Lohan is in the movie? I like the work shes done in her movies. Yeah, she perfect for the role. Really I didn't know Tina Fay wrote movies. that's kinda cool. So what is the movie about? like what is lohans role in the film? Lohan is the new kid in school and encounters a clique: the mean girls Oh so do the MEAN GIRLS give her a problem the entire movie? Well, they invitie her into their clique. Does it work out for her joining the Clique? Another girl get jeleous of this and uses Lohan to get revenge on one of the Mean Girls Ahhh so it's like real life. very close to real highschool drama Yeah. I won't give you the ending, but its hilarious in a dark sort of way. oh ok. is there any other famous people in the movie? It's also a great conversational flick. I like convo movies, though usually those are serious. Tina Fey should get credit I guess I didn't recognize anyone else. Amanda Seyfried is in it though. Ohh ok i know her. Is it a long movie like more than 2 hours? I foget. Time flew. Is it a kid-friendly movie or is there a lot of cursing and/or nudity. Yeah. Kid friendly. it ends with the Prom, like all Teen movies. Not quite as climatic as Carrie tho its based on a non-fcition book, btw. A book about high school social cliques. So Tina Fey should get a lot of credit for adapting it into a movie. That's very creative.
i do data entry how about you ? i mainly work for an extra for major motion pictures
i think all holidays are horrible i have no opinion about holidays . i do like rudolph . i would like rudolph for dinner

hi Hello, How are you? how re you fine have you watch the movie the incaption I am well. Inception? I have the movie about the man Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a thief with the rare ability to enter people's dreams and steal their secrets from their subconscious. Yes, I have seen Inception. I love this movie. His skill has made him a hot commodity in the world of corporate espionage but has also cost him everything he loves. Cobb gets a chance at redemption yes i know very unique subject Yes, It is quite interesting how he can enter the dreams like that. the : Christopher Nolanood director g When did it come out? 2010 science fiction film Ah wow. I did not realize it was that old of a movie already. May 10, 2010 Seems like it just came out a couple years ago. haha it did 828.3 million USD business Who else stars in it? I do not remember the girl. That is alot of money. Ellan page Ah ok. Thanks, Great actress. Leonardo DiCaprio as a professional thief who steals information by infiltrating the subconscious, and is offered a chance to have his criminal history erased as payment for the implantation of another person's idea into a target's subconscious. Is the movie long? normal duration 1>30 min when did you saw?? it was released in both conventional and IMAX theaters beginning on July 16, 2010 It has been a couple years since I have seen it. Have you seen it? yes I think I may have to watch this again soon. the effects were very good. what you like most have you enjoyed?? i enjoy a lot buy
Yes! Great movie Have you? it  has a lot of action and I think its better made that most batman movies Being that Batman Begins is the beginning to the new modern saga for Batman have you seen the entire series? yes they all kick butt , but the depth of the story is best in the first the other ones that include the joker have the action, but the story behind why they are so evil in the first place should be mentioned o those that arent really familiar with the series Yes, especially how "Ra's Al Ghul" began as an issue really in "Batman Begins" and then later in "The Dark Knight Rises" is mentioned. The series is very well constructed. Yeah agreed about the Joker part, I mean in the movie they kind of hint at why he has issues. BUT it would be nice to know what exactly spurred as a catalyst for it all yes they have a serious twist in the plot of the movie and they did make sure that villiams and main characters somehow connect with future events yes I know that he got into a lot of chems, but the story on how that happened should be put into a movie, so far not even the older batman movies make it clear You know what would have been nice? If they explained a bit more in detail about Bruce Waynes parents. Yes they are murdered but I dont feel connected as a viewer to them really its showed in comic books, but not everyone is able to get a hold of them or they are considered to be outdated and are no longer looked at. which is a major catalyst as to why he even chose to be Batman correct, I barely know anything about them and I think that they could make a sparete story on the dad since his company in the first place was researching advanced weaponry and building it in secret Really? I never knew that They made it seem as though he was some man of peace or something thats were batman recaived all his gadgets and stuff his dad was building weapons at the company,  but they never went into the story why he was doing that
Hello How are doing? I am well, how are you? Fine thank you! So would you say you are a Batman fan? Not a superfan, I'm not familiar with all the backstory, but I have really enjoyed the new movies. Have you seen all of the Batman movies starring Christian Bale? Definitely. Its a great thing you mentions those movies since Batman Begins started the iconic Nolan trilogies. Out of the three which is your favorite Ok... Well which of the three Bale films are your favorite Batman Begins really got me hooked. I watched that one several times. The ending really got me! Did you see the identity of Ra's al Ghul coming? I was totally surprised.

Elsa has cryokinetic magic.  That's an interesting magic to have. There's a scene in the movie where Elsa and her sister Anna are kids and Elsa uses her magic on her.  Unfortunately her parents isolated them both caused both to have developmental issues. Amazing dear And like in lots of fairy tales and Disney movies, the parents of course die - this time in a storm at sea. OK Thankyou So Elsa grows up insecure about her magical powers.  At 21, she becomes queen but is worried people will find out about her magic. Her magic is very interesting
I agree and I really loved Gwyneth Paltrow in anything. She's very versatile and played a convincing Pepper Potts for sure.

It's an average length of approximately 90 minutes but will have you thinking continually throughout So it's a brain bender? :D 100%, their goal during the flight is to plan a 'seed' in the mind of the son to inherit his dead father's fortune.  Leonardo accepts the mission as it is the only way he can see his children again, who were left in care following his framed murder charge.

I thought the part about Buzz thinking he was a real astronaut just added to the story
Rotten Tomato's is a hard one to score high on too! It's a great thing the movie did so will and was able to mix comic-book with live action. That's what I like about it too. It was a superhero movie but it still felt like real people were in it. Do you normally watch a lot of superhero movies? Honestly I don't really care much for them other than the Batman and Superman movies.  What about you? Same here honestly but I really enjoyed this movie. It was dark and moody and it really explored Batman's damaged psyche. I also liked Katie Holmes in her role as Rachel Dawes Are you still there? The movie goes into the childhood trauma that Bruce Wayne suffered
i do not have do you have kids
ow long have you been playing football ? my whole life last year was my first as a quarterback
right . you are absolutely right . check out praxis .
i work for uncle sammy lol oh , you in the military ?
But like most of the times, the evil doers have to fall, and this one wasn't going to escape. It was his decision tho, if he wanted he could have gone somewhere else, but he couldn he couldn't accept what his mother did. I believe he saw Carl as a father figure

The blind side whats it about? football really? yeah not my thing me neither The film received moderately positive reviews, with critics praising Sandra Bullock'sperformance. ok "It might strike some viewers as a little too pat, but The Blind Side has the benefit of strongsource material and a strong performance from Sandra Bullock." good don't really like sandra bullock oh, why
funny but i can make fart noises . . . under my arms ! and i am not too bad ! hat is gross . i have an intense fear of clowns .
ot much into hiking myself , only way i get around is with my truck . what type of truck do you have ? i drive a pretty big f150 , i love it . i bet . by the way my name is david , but you can call me dave .

I remember he ranked very high when he was taking his career test. It definitely translated well into his efforts in football. Do you think that helped his family as well? I'm sure it did.  It's ironic, though, that he has such strong protective instincts when he was abandoned by his mother. Do you think he was overcompensating? How did you feel about the scene where Collins adopts Oher?
So did I. Do you usually like Leonardo DiCaprio? I would say that yeah, I usually he do. He tends to be a really good actor in any movie that he's in. Tom Hanks was great too. I'm usually not as big of a Tom Hanks fan as I am of DiCaprio, but he did a great job.
happy birthday ! i have 6 brothers and sisters . yours going to celebrate today ? he theme of the party is superman cuz he is my favorite superhero . u do not know your parents ? ot my birth parents . i was adopted as an infant , 8 weeks old . sorry . no biggie . lots of comic book heroes do not know their parents . if i was a superhero i would not be so afraid of what lies ahead . superman was adopted and he turned out great . except fot the last movie . lol . did not see it . my father helped work on computer imaging for superman movies . cool ! my dad says its ok to be afraid as long as it does not freeze you . its ok . hewitt packard is having layoffs so he is worried . he needs superman ! should buy comic books . that will help him . i love them ! i will tell him that todd told him to get some ! cool , can you send me drawings of superman your dad did ?
ice , i did the same for the first 5 or so years . miss it some days yeah , you get back into it
Don Rickles was too funny as Mr. Potato Head.  I really loved the Rex. Now the Rex I don't remember too well, but the actor Wallace Shawn, do you know him from other films? What genre of movies do you generally like?

Romantic comedy is my favorite. I went to this one because of my FB usage and I was intrigued.
I think the low cinema score was due to it been banned in some countries That is true My opinion is It was a great movie Hard to believe this was a 2013 movie, seems like a newer movie to me It was an excellent movie for sure It is actually how it is in the real world pretty much Well...whats fascinates me more is the fact that it really happened and that person exists I found myself googling about the real life character

I’m exactly certain if I can say the title. It did not say, but it is woman wonder, and rotten tomatos gives it 92%. I have only seen bits and pieces of it Not exactly certain* sorry, typo It is based on dc comics so if you like those you may like this Starts out on her journey as a little girl to become a superhero It is a war movie set In World War One Are you there?
oronto , in a medical facility . in your blimp ? sounds rad maybe i can add some other steampunk elements to it ; but i have not worked out the engineering . . . do you like any music ?
You're right about Spielberg, I never thought of it like that. The movie got such an amazing review on Rotten Tomatoes, 96%. The really speaks volumes to the directing by Spielberg and the acting by DiCaprio, Hanks, and the rest of the cast. I was hoping you would bring up the cast. I assume I have to respond to you rather than raise a subject. tom Hanks is, in my opinion, the best actor out there. And DiCaprio really turns into his characters as well. Just the names of the stars was enough to recommend the movie to me. and you're right the amazing review only made it clearer that it was a non-miss. In the movie when the FBI turned to Abagnale to help to catch forged checks adds a little humor to the movie and kind of takes the audience away of how serious Abagnale's crimes were. I think that truly worked to the movie's advantage. I find it amazing that a 19-year-old succeeded in impersonating people that were obviously much older than 19. He was an absolute genious.. I agree! I would have never known he was 19 unless I was told! As for what you wrote at the same time I sent my message. Yes! It was such an ironic turn of events. But he certainly had the mind to get into anyone's mind, including other forgers. I think that Frank's family having financial issues and having to drastically downsize led him towards his passion and drive to get money. What do you think of Frank's family?
oh , no . why is that ? i work a lot and do not have a lot of free time what do you do if you do have any free time ? ravel i do like to run on the weekends oh fun ! where do you usually go running ?

wesome . i would love to visit tennessee like i love visiting seattle .
i would love to go to school , and to learn self defense . self defense is important . just go take tae kwon do its so expensive tho , saving to move it can be pricey . i live at home currently but trying to go to dorms i wanna move to las vegas full of excitement and all kinds of folk
i have two girls . do you have any kids ?
yes it is , i have to relax because i work 60 hrs a week hat sounds rough , what do you do ? drink and smoke the green haha what else do you like to do ? other than working drinking and smoking , also despising my boss
re you following in their footsteps ? o . i am a struggling actress . do you live near the beach ? i live in ny . i found out so much about myself here . hat is a bummer , my favorite place in the world is the beach . i am actually from hawaii . re you , is it amazing ? it is . but you yearn for something different . which brings me to ny .
i used to bet on dog races . then my dog died . i am not complete . sorry to hear that . i have not dated since high school sorry to hear that . did you learn anything from your parents ? orses . that is why i plan to have a teaching program for racing them hat is good . the world is where i find inspiration . my parents taught me that . for sure . i like learning too me too . i like to learn to create new items . i might create doggy items . hat sounds good . maybe i can learn to do that so i can date again
long day ? did you work or stay up late last night ? i am great . i have a job in a factory , so it takes a lot out of me . what time do you get off ? i totally can relate . i am off at 4 but i work 4 days a week 10 hours per day .
do you have any pet ? yes , i have 4 cats and they are so adorable ice . i heard cats are easier than dogs
wow , very diverse . i do not go further than my couch really . sit here all day . hat is no fun get out and see the world i like being at home with the puppy . i eat a lot and should really limit that . yeah maybe do you like mcdonalds their fries are the best
, but i am such a bad example to kids man . if you went to school , i doubt that . you must have some confidence . sure , but if i cannot eat my veggies how can i tell kids to ? ! just tell them they need to do it more than you since they are still growing . i could try , but i am also bad at handling backtalk . bad temper , or short . set up a punishment schedule to keep you both in line . what if we all just sat around and sang alands morisette songs instead ? ll probably not . i work with college kids and that would not work . what ? that seems like the best route for college kids ! h . maybe the artsy ones , but i have the jocks . jocks can be sensitive too ! maybe . i guess we are all just too focused on the game .
hat sounds nice . how many kids do you have ? welve kids . i know , it sounds like a handful to take care of but they are all grown oh wow . i have one daughter and she keeps me busy lol . good for you ood thing you have only one child . twelve was stressful lol i can imagine , definitely worth it though i bet . ow old are you and how old your daughter ? i am 53 i am 27 and my daughter is 1 and a 1 2 . i am looking to move from alabama to somewhere else within the next year oh do you plan on moving far ? i live in wisconsin . i am originally from pennsylvania so maybe i might move back there hat is a beautiful state , very hilly and green . yes although i am not fond of the crazy weather . i recently dyed my hair blonde
The soundtrack was great too, Hans Zimmer was fantastic. I like sci-fi movies but I don't normally watch movies. Yeah, Hans Zimmer is such a visionary. The moment I see him pop up on a Soundtrack I know it'll be great. I don't regularly watch movies, but I occasionally do when I've got time. Big movies like Inception find their way in. Same here, he also did the soundtrack for Blade Runner 2049 Ah! I have yet to see that, but heard good things about it. What are your thoughts on the whole science side of things in Inception? You think the whole "dream-sharing" tech could become something of a reality in the future? I feel like there would be massive disasters before the level of tech would be up there. What do you think? Almost definitely lol It's bad enough people are having issues with reality, but when dealing with dreams.. who knows what could happen. I've seen and read enough sci-fi that I'm apprehensive about it. But it could have positive ramifications I suppose as well.
beautiful . is that okay ? do not tell me wife i can live with that . tell me something about yourself . i am from michigan . i have some pets cool . i am from new york and have a small cat . i have a cat too . how amazing mine is named rose after my favorite flower . is everything about you beautiful ?

First half is good one. Whos your favorite character How many time u watch ? ive seen it multiple tiems times Oh super.... do you think it had a deeper meaning?
hat sound good i love music what kind to you like most ?
perfect pitch is what my friends say i have , but i disagree .
A friends dad asked the coach of a private school to get him enrolled Was this based on a true story? That was Quinton Aaron Yes a true story
oh that was a good one But yes John Legend as an actor... I can't picture that yeah From the documents provided it seems that Ryan's character is a bit of a jerk so in the last line they say that the lead is a "jazz snob." wonder what that means? yeah i was just reading that He is a jazz snob and she lacks depth. but it has great reviews? perhaps the other reviewers are reading too into it. i mean, anyone can be called a snob of anything is theyre deeply passionate about something that others are "meh" about. Perhaps he is just more focused on his career and she is a distraction for him. Some people find it difficult to be upfront about that sort of thing
llo , what are you up to ? i am just watching netflix , you ? i am playing piano , practicing hat is cool . are you passionate about music ? yes , i have taken lessons since i was 5 , i have a band . i like money more than i like music what do you do for a living ? i work as a nanny do you like to watch children ? i do . they are cute and they are fun i bet . i write my own music with my best friend , she also plays i could not do that lol i am too blonde i just died my hair silver , it is hard to care for just like a blonde

I doubt it. People with money get it by keeping the flow as one way as possible, if you know what I mean. Anyway, everyone's cheering their heads off over the popularity so it's expanded to Yale, Columbia, and Stanford.
Sure have, was a personal favorite of mine years ago. I love pixar and Tim Allen I like how Pixar movies are entertaining for kids as well as adults. same here! It's interesting to look back at this film thinking about how Buzz comes to the realization that he is just a toy do you watch many animated films? I will if they look interesting. I'm not a big fan of animated movies specifically geared towards kids though. What's your favorite Pixar movie? hmmm hard choice but Ratatouille is awesome. Crazy to think that this came out in 1995 over twenty years ago I know! I still remember seeing it in the theater. I think my favorite is still The Incredibles. as a kid this movie always made me wish my toys would turn into living things I remember bursting into my room sometimes trying to catch my toys talking to each other. :D Was Buzz Lightyear your favorite character?
I do. Romantic comedies mostly but this will be good Yeah, there's no romance here, but plenty of familial fluff Since you like superhero movies this should fill you up as well. Yep! Even if there are no heroes Well Unless you count the girls At least I wont have to cover my eyes and ears. Lol No heros? There has to be a hero. Gru, the villain and the protagonist, might count as the hero? Does it sound like one of the girls are going to be a huge character in this movie But it's mostly his growing relationship with the daughters he adopts Gru is a funny name It is! Suitable for a Disney villain, though So he was a bachelor and he gets to have a family that is cool Yep! I agree. I mean, he already had the minions And they tried but they're not very effective at, well, anything Yes but they weren't seen as a family. So does he fight the other antagonist?

No, I don't think he did. He should have, though. Did you like Margot Robbie as Naomi? Margot Robbie is one of my faves she was great. And Jonah hill too! would you consider it a black comedy? I'm not sure. Leo was a lead and he's white, so I'm 50/50 on it. What's your opinion? I know it is labeled a black comedy, so I will go with that. We aren't the only ones that liked it. It has a 78% rating on rotten tomatoes That's a pretty good rating. It's interesting that it deals with such serious concepts like corruption and is still a comedy. One of my favorite directors is Martin Scorsese and he directed this film. It's a pretty crazy movie for an old director like him. You're right! It did get some pretty harsh criticism but I think it had some interesting characters. New York is certainly always an interesting location. I like that it is set in the late 80's and love seeing how he takes the negative of being fired after black monday and then creates an empire
yes . what else do you do for fun ? when i can snag a role , i like working as an extra in movies and writing screenplays . oh so cool . what types of movies are your favorite ? ction and horror . . . i do all my own stunts .

The animation on it is great! the animation is pretty good too for that time lol the part where night fury and hiccup in the forests were too good and the fight scenes were great yes the viking era was shown better It's also a great Coming-of-age story the friendship between hicupp and night fury was developed carefully with fun and creative ideas and the dragon fighting classes were hilarious Yes agreed, the Directors did such a great job Hiccup did such a great job training  Toothless Yes where he tickles the dragon to win it over .. man the script writers were too funny So many different dragons too! and how he trains with prosthetic fin with toothless were well captured and so smart of Hiccup too! and when all the kids join with him and use the dragons to fight the big one in the climax  .. and how he lose his leg just like toothless are all added to include emotional drama It was such sad scene between Hiccup and his father when Hiccup was trying to convince his dad that toothless was not a danger and the dad angers the dragons into attaking instead such chaos

Hey. Yes, I have. Did you like it I thought it was just alright. Yeah it was a little slow at times Agreed. But most of these type of movies are. Yeah, it did have some good people in it though That never really mattered to me. I would have seen it either way since the story interests me.
Russell Brand and Steve Carell are probably good as the villains in this scene. They are usually pretty funny Sounds like it would be pretty funny It says the film has a song by Pharrell, I think I've heard that on the radio
i feel like i do everything , and it takes forever meaning i start early and leave late i work at the zoo

I think my favorite is when they're getting expelled from the university but then get offered jobs in the mail room to join the scare team Yes, thats good too. I liked when they joined the misfits too Oh absolutely, how would you rate the movie yourself? I would say its 7.5/10. what do you think?
Leo DiCaprio is pretty good, though I'm not normally a fan of his. 2002 Have you seen it? i love him, he is a good actor but a little overrated :) no what genre? Biographical crime film no the type of movies i usually watch are ratings good?
I do.  I liked them even before I had kids. Do you think the Rotten Tomatoes rating is accurate for the movie? I guess.  Truthfully, I don't let the Rotten Tomatoes rating ever influence my decision in watching movies. Yeah, I guess sometimes you just need to judge a movie for yourself. Did you think a prequel was appropriate or should they have made a sequel instead? Indeed.  It's hard to believe that Monsters University was Pixar's fourteenth feature film. I loved the fact that it was a prequel. It was something a little different.  It is always cool to get a bit of a backstory. Yes, it was interesting to see how Mike and Sulley got together. Yeah.  There was also a cute factor about seeing the characters as little monsters. I liked how they showed that Mike originally wanted to become a scarer. Yeah, I like that too. It's also creative that in the monster world they use scream for energy. The creativity that comes with Monsters University is top notch. The two characters contrasted well with Mike as the studious one and Sulley relying on natural abilty.
hat is inspiring . you sound like a determined person . i have been able to accumulate some wealth here in japan . wow , japan . i have never even left my hometown .
i do ! i have a two year old little girl . you ?
I think he sees that the dragons are not complete beasts. What do you think? After all he's been fighting them at age 15. Maybe he is just using that as a strategy. True. I think he was desensitized and tricked by these evil creatures. I think he's falling into their trap. I don’t think all of them are evil. One of them tried to protect him Scene 3 Hiccups show the creature to his father.
othing better than a hot drink on a day like this ! so what are your hobbies ? o help pass time away i have been brewing beer of all kinds cool ! brewing beer for yourself or to sell ? mostly myself but for some friends also time to time
A pretty all star cast then i see. Yeah I would say so. is it based on the book "The Accidental Billionaires." Yeah, the bookwas published in 2009. Is it true to events? Yes, it is based on true events. It all started because Mark was upset that his girlfriend dumped him. And is that what cause him to create facebook? He created a website called Facemash by hacking into college database to steal photos of female students the allowing visitors to rate their attractiveness. Intersting! I never knew that, it certainly sounds good. would you recommend it? Oh yes I have seen it before it's more of a comedic documentery Comedic? It actually sounds really good. yeah I would defiantly recommend it. Cool i will give it  a watch then! Great! don't forget he was only 19 when he created facebook.
i was recently diagnosed with autism

IM not sure its a major city What year was Ace? 94 Oh yes, adult. I think we can finish this now! aw man asce ventura was the best kid movie in my eyes yay! have a good day!
family is everything , the older i get the more special it becomes i learned that when i was younger in singing competitions all i had was my dad
I also love the characters and actors they've assigned to do the voices.  A diminutive sheep as assistant mayor, an eager rabbit, an african water buffalo as chief of police.  And, a fox as the con artist.  Sounds entertaining and interesting
Good afternoon hey how are  you good. I loved this movie and so did my kids. me too as well, very funny movie i would say especially with the character being a police officer but they put her in charge of something that she did not want to do I think that Jason Bateman did an excellent job as Nick. and dont forget idrs elba as nick wilde, very good story and easy to follow it's also funny they made the smallest animal the cop. it is however fitting that they made the fox the con artist but you know i grew up with cartoon and now how the animation is very good animation sequences and even if they dont look like a big deal i think the very technology that makes these moveis happen make very cool stories that far are better than the movies i watched growin up I agree. The animation is so fluid and believable now. pretty deep underlying subject matter for a kids movie. yea i bet that is why we can also watch an enjoy these movies as adults I am glad they made a more serious plot in this movie and not just fluff. You're right it does make it much more enjoyable as the parent. I also enjoy the personification of animals. It makes the animation that much more fun. yea always loved stories about animals what if they could talk and this movie goes very far i agree with you Animals in tax evasion is PRETTY far! I also like the tension of 10 hours to figure out the case.
Yeah, I mean known actors having fun, you know it never feels forced
s a hobby . my father taught me how when i was a kid . hat is useful . i never really learned . i was too obsessed with animals . its not difficult . you can just start by following recipes . hat is kinda what i do . google is my guide lol . hen you just have to start adjusting for your personal taste . yeah . i am better than burning water . i just have to expand my recipe book . its really easy once you get the hang of it .

I do not know, but the movie was also executive-produced by steve jobs. That's part of the fun of watching TS...figuring out the different voices! Yes. It is a very imaginative movie. That is appealing to both kids and adults. I don't think there's a Pixar movie I don't like.

yes that is a good idea , its too much yelling in the middle of the night when i was a champion skier in college , we had great parties in the night .
I know it seems like it is newer. The film received moderately positive reviews and Sandra Bullock who is great was praised for her role. Can you tell me a little bit about the movie? I have always like Sandra Bullock :) liked* It is based on a true story about the NFL football player Michael "Big MIke" Oher's high school experience and college recruitment to NFL career. He was from an impoverished home and was adopted by Sean and Leigh Ann Tuohy who were able to send him to a private christian school where he struggled academically but excelled in football. That sounds like an interesting storyline. I remember it getting quite a bit of attention when it first came out. This gave him an advantage and he was able to attend college and was a first round pick of the Ravens NFL team It is based on a true story, right? Wow, that is amazing. He truly came from humble beginnings! Yes it is based on a true story and very uplifting movie. I know you weren't convinced by the rotten tomatoes score, but Cinamascore review was an A+ Was Mike older than the other kids in his high school??? I am just picturing the cast and I know he was much, much bigger than his classmates! Oh, that is pretty redeeming!
After awhile I forgot she was mute. She was so caring. Reminded me of Beauty an the Beast somewhat hmm...u r right
you are so smart . how did you know he is kung fu panda ? i have heightened senses and knowledge
you want to retire ? i also like to work with animals you interested ? yes i do . want to travel the country in a rv yes , it is very beautiful , you should come see me . i like animals . where do you live ?
I just started, please give me a second, please. It was very amazing how Tony made his exoskeleton! Agreed. He was a genius inventor! Was he your favorite character? Friday did good at hiding her feeling for Tony and he did not notice.  He was not my favorite due to that piece. I understand. I didn't really have a favorite as I liked them all but Downey Jr's portrayal of Tony Stark and Iron Man was perfect. I also enjoyed Jeff Bridges as Obadiah Stane. He was the perfect villain! That he was.  I felt as though he was the tony I have always read about.  The villain had me sitting on the edge of my seat. Agreed. So did you feel the score of  A that Cinemascore gave the film was appropriate? Yes,  It was all put together well.  Do you think it was a military thriller?
i am great how about yourself tonight ? i am good do you like soccer ? yea we play soccer on the farm sometimes i want to live in london for the soccer lol i live in ohio on a farm lol

and tim allen as buzz i liked the evolution of their friendship from rivals Yeah they hated eachother at first but became great friends yes it also felt very fresh The whole movie has a great theme- Friendship is important not like the other disney movies I agree very important! Pixar makes some great movies so imaginative but this one is my favorite of them one of the other characters i really enjoyed was rex I love how whenever a human comes in the room  that all they toys "play dead" I loved Mr Potatoa head haha oh yes *potato Did you know he was played by Don Rickles? i feel like rex (when the movie started) was so nervous but he finally hit his stride and became more confident yes! mr potato head had the best and driest one liners too funny Rickles was perfect for it sid was so awful wasn't he Yeah, it's funny- they show him grown up as a garbage man in one of the sequels haha yes! serves him right for being so mean lol
If you saw a movie about a down-on-his-luck tv reporter that gets the powers of God, that's the one. Sure did! Does the movie seem like it goes quickly or do you feel there are slow parts in the film? I think it is fast. The hilarious slapstick makes time fly by. That's the only humor that speaks to my IQ. I'm looking forward to it. I like that they cast Morgan Freeman as God, too. The whole cast was well-picked. Some of the critical reception to the movie was a bit mixed, though. Morgan Freeman is a pretty great God. Jim Carrey loses his mind. This is the first in the "almighty" series, right? I think the second is Evan Almighty. Yup, Steve Carrell is in both! Bruce Nolan (Carrey) is jealous of him and is seen as too comedic by Carrell.
The movie is from 2005. So you can watch it on DVDs Thats great I would like to watch  it Bruce Wayne travels around the world and finds League of Shadows whats league of shadows?

I think Jaws is a bit too gruesome for children, but good for adults. Do you watch it more than once?
So its like walk in someone else's shoes to see what they have to deal with. More as in "why God leaves some prayers unanswered" oh ok Bruce starts responding with yeses to all the prayers he receives, and as you can imagine that's were a lot of the conflict AND comedy come in to play I enjoy comedy that is funny but has a good story line. oh yea this one definetly has both and then the story to with Jennifer Annistons character as well Would you recommend this movie? oh yea From what you have said about Bruce Almighty it seems like a very good movie. I actually forgot about it, and how well written it is now that I really think about it its a bit of a tear jerker too lol I am looking forward to adding it to my list of movies to watch. I like feel good movies but do cry easy during movies that are tear jerkers. I would add this one, its worth watching I hope my movie store has it.

Hahaha yeah! Double culture shock for Cady Although it is based on a nonfiction book it seems to greatly exaggerate a lot of things! dont you think? To know what to do at that age is hard enough, add that kind of shock... Yes, I do think it exaggerates a lot. Perhaps it doesn't, but I was never exposed to the amount of bullying and drama. I was not exposed to it either. And the cliques seem unrealistic in the sense that they only hang out with each other.
Not very. More comedy. He booby traps the house with the kinds of things an 8-year old would come up with to get the burglars. I really like horror movies. Would you consider it somewhat close to that genre? No, it's a comedy. Not scary. Ohhhh I see. I enjoy comedies once in a while too.What is your favorite movie genre? I like comedies too. This one is up there. In the beginning, it's funny when a power outage turns off the clocks and makes the family oversleep. That's why they forget Keven (Culkin) at home. I am starting to remember the previews now!Daniel Stern is in it too...and Joe Pesci!? You got it. They play the burglars. Chris Columbus was the director. There was a sequel too...was there a third one? I feel like I really should have seen that movie by now, but I just hadn't gotten around to watching it. Not sure. I only know about the first one. Another funny part is that the mom has to hitch a ride with a traveling polka band to get back home to Kevin. Ha. When do they realize they forgot him? They realize after they get off the plane for their Paris vacation, but there are no flights back, so the mom flies to the US but has to hitch that ride. It takes her a while. What is your favorite part? I think I just like the way Kevin booby traps the whole house. It's like a Rube Goldberg machine. Pardon me but what is a Rube Goldberg machine?
yeah had a lot of things like that happen

Hello You ever seen this movie before?
las not so much , but my close friends and family do enjoy my blends
o . i do not .
The fashion must have been great. Did the movie age well? I think it did, seems to be one of those classic movies that everyone talks about these days. It isn't until christmas that his parents get back and kevin is a bit upset about that. Oh so it's during Christmas? Would you say it's a Christmas movie or is it good for any season? Good for any season in my opinion It sounds like a great movie, I should check it out.
ouch ! what do you think of pink hair ? i just dyed my hair pink i live in california , yes i have heard of it .
You're right, 92% on Rotten Tomatoes is pretty rare for a superhero movie. I totally agree about the Batman Superman stuff. The actors don't even seem that into it. Who was your favorite character in Wonder Woman? I usually like the main characters the most so Gal Gadot really made me enjoy the movie. I was just about to ask you if you think any of the actors could of been replaced to make it better. Hmm, interesting question. I really don't know. It may be more of a writing issue than an acting issue. But, I think all the actors in Wonder Woman were really well picked. Even the people they got to play the gods were really good. What did you think of the amazon island where she grew up? Do you think they did a good job portraying that? I did, it set off the vibe really well in my opinion. It captured you to want to know more I think. The filming was really great there. I wonder how long it took them while they were filming
I can't remember. It's really just a film about the decadent lifestyles of the stockbrokers And all the prostitutes and affairs and drugs Rob Reiner is always funny
hat does sound like a good time . . . except i do not like alcohol
I agree
well , it sucks its not as rewarding in the process . expensive ll college is expensive , but at least one day i will be saving lives . what do you do outside of school ? i help my mom with her baking and watch old movies . you ? i currently reside on an island , so i fish and toy with bots
i lost my parents a long while ago to a car accident . oh i am sorry to hear that hank you but it was a long time ago .
rue . what do you do for work ? i sell stuff on the internet , not much money but its a living
I saw it many years ago Yes, same! And just recently as well. I really do enjoy Robert Downey Jr as Iron Man. I can't believe it has been 10 years since it came out. That's crazy. I know, it feels like couple years I like Robert Downey too Time flies. Haha. Would you watch it again? Definitely! Did you see it on the big screen the first time? I normally do agree with Rotten Tomatoes scores. A 94 for this movie is pretty good. I saw it on DVD but still was fun
So, I should watch the first movie before this? Well no.. You can watch this one before, because this happens as young adults/teens. The director is Dan Scanton. It sounds interesting. I like most Pixar movies. Did it make you cry at any point? No, I don't think it is sad, it just more about how a odd friendship between two complete different people occurs. Mike isn't a scary enough monster, so Sulley is like his partner in crime
Have you ever seen the movie Iron Man? no not big on movies LOL but I am definetetly interested in learning about it It's really worth checking out. It Stars Robert Downey Jr. who's really really energtic in the role of Tony Stark, A.K.A Iron Man. is tony still acting seems interesting, ill have to check it out. what kind of movie is it
lol Bruce himself is a field reporter and isn't seen by his coworkers as a potential anchor because he is too funny. ok sounds good so far When Bruce is given the powers of God, he causes all kinds of hilarious things to happen that help him become anchor and Evan gets fired. It was really hilarious when he caused Evan (Steve Carell) to humiliate himself on air and lose his job. lol that seems useful He also had to answer people's prayers with Yes or No, there were a lot of prayers.  So he said "Yes" to everyone and the results were disastrous. thanks so far it seems like a movie i would watch Yeah, it's a good one. lol that all seems crazy how did the critics like it Morgan Freeman is God in the movie and he cleans everything up in the end.  Bruce lost his girlfriend because of being self absorbed, but he got her back at the end. Rotten Tomatoes 48% and average 5.7/10, Metacritic 46/100, CinemaScore: A of course i love how morgan freeman always seems to play the role of god thanks for the chat bye Yeah there's something about his height and voice.
yes obviously 1995 Hard to believe this was 23 years ago
not to bad considering the type of movie, i dont know how to nail it down but it just wasnt very engaging I see. How are the special effects? it could be that we are getting oversaturated with comic book superhero movies I think they were ok So would you say this movie is worse than other super hero movies that have come out recently? Have you seen any comic book movies? a few yeah considering how big and long it was hyped up dang. how long was it? some have gotten to the point were they make fun of themselvs a bit it ads a nice touch i feel so there's some humor involved? I dont know about the standard version i saw the directors cut(or whatever its called) I think it was around three hours- that may have added to the drag of it not in this one, but others have that
Definitely still a thumbs up for me. It's a classic movie. Have you ever read the novel by Peter Benchley? I haven't!  I wonder if that's why the movie was so good at scaring people even without the shark visual, because you don't have the luxury of visualization while reading a book.  Overall, what did you think of Spielberg's directing? Well there's a reason why it's still remembered so much 40 years later. I agree with one of the reviewers who said that he knows how to tell a story. It really makes an impression. Definitely agree that it was a scary thriller.  Do you remember the name of the police chief?  I like whoever the actor was that played him. The chief was played by Martin Brody. I agree he was really good. For me though, the best performance was the shark hunter, whose name I forget. Robert Shaw, I think, played Quint the shark hunter guy.  What did you think of that opening scene?
hi , i love halloween , so what do you like to do for fun ? i have several , shopping with my girls , hunting with my man and i am a house flipper ! hat is nice ! i enjoy doing beadwork and writing my own patterns . we that is creative ! i do not have the patients for that sorta thing . i like fast stuff ! sure is ! where you from that you can go hunting ? idaho would you like a potato ? haha lol i grew up on a farm in va but moved to pa ow are the philly cheese steaks i have always wanted to try one ?

Are you know inception I saw inception and was completely confused. I could hardly follow what was going on in the movie. Talk about "inception." Have you seen it? Yes ! Rating was grate I love Leonardo DiCaprio. I thought he did great.
I'd say so, what else can you tell me It was also the very first feature-length computer-animated movie. And Pixar's first film. really? I actually did not know that to both those I am trying to remember some scenes... Same here. Well, Andy (who is the owner of the toys) is supposed to have a birthday party, but it gets rescheduled because they are preparing to move. They hate birthday parties because sometimes the toys get replaced. But instead of a replacement, Buzz is brought into the family. Yup, Woody wasn't worried at first the way that Tim Allen portrayed Buzz Lightyear was priceless How long is the movie? You know, I actually don't have that information. A big part of the movie is the fact the Buzz doesn't realize he is a toy.  He thinks he is a real space ranger. oh, okay thats fine Yeah thats what I was talking about, his laser beam hahahaha when he chokes with his helmet is opened Haha yea, that is classic.  They end up at Pizza Planet and get stuck in a toy machine, which is where the neighbor Sid gets a hold of him. ugh I hated Sid Yea, he was a twerp. His poor toys.
i like winning things . i like remembering when i won grade three spelling bee . i very much like the smell of leather i wear it all the time i end up wearing drinks if i get too verbally aggressive with my drunk customers makes sense i would throw my drink at a bartender for that you would think five wives would have taught me something about self control 4 cats and 2 dogs would scare most people away but we have a blast

I think they are saying it could be made into a play, not that they would. But it would be a nice play! Have you read the book it was based on? I have not! I haven't read most of Hans Christian Andesen's work, but this one I hadn't even heard of. Have you? No, I haven't read much of Andersen's works. What was your favorite song?
re you homeless ? i know people are always looking for esl teachers . o and do you have any animals ? o . no pets . my girlfriend wanted sole custody of our dog what happen between you and your girlfriend i wanted to go vegan and also throw away the tv . i guess just different life directions
He was funny as a kid :p u will enjoy As I read it or read about it it seems super interesting this witty kid kevin in this movie acted very well in all parts This the one that Kevin or McAuley Culkin said a bunch of traps to protect his house It was like three stooges slapstick Kinda Oh I see Joe Pesci was in it he is amazing yes he is yes did protect his house but did a lot of mess too his tricks was unbeleivable when i was young i enjoyed his every single tricks some of them i tried in childhood . It also looks like a really good Christmas movie because the mom tries to get the whole family back together for Christmas back safely Yeah I think I  want to see this it was soo sad when the poor child kevin was left behind first i thought this part wont gonna work but later on when that two bad ass buddies got injuries that made me hahhahahha Yeah I definitely have to see this it seems really fun the film's first half is flat and unsurprising Were  there are a bunch of these home alone movies  searching my DVR the second half is praised for its slapstick humor

It starts out with Mark getting dumped and making a site called Facemash by hacking into the college database. That's a weird thing to do. Then what? Then the site gets super popular and Zuckerberg gets caught. What happens after he is caught? His friends approach him and start working on a site together. Then they start Thefacebook and it gets popular. What happens after it gets popular?

Not really, its hard to believe that Toy Story was from 1995, it doesnt seem like it was that long ago It really was.  In fact, it was Pixar's first animated full-length feature film. Pixar, in my opinion, was such a step up from regular animation. It really raised the bar with the current edge techniques and use of computer animation. I liked all the pranks and antics of the toys, it gave them real personality Speaking of antics, do you remember the scene when Andy and his family are heading to Pizza Planet and his mother will only let him bring one toy? Yes, its so hard to choose amongst your friends.  But watching Buzz and Woody go from enemies to friends,, is such a great evolution to watch.  Its also a great lesson for kids, and grown ups
okay how many victims does jaws have? i don't remember being more than like 3
Hi Yes i have seen that movie What stood out to you? I think the cast was great. Culkin and Pesci did a great job as Kevin and Harry! I cant believe that it is from 1990 How funny is that Yes. Time flies. Interesting the movie got mediocre reviews. How funny it is that kevin got left behind on vacation I thought it was a good movie though It seems like the critics were not nice to the movie Agreed. I thought the plot was quite original Yes me too. It was amusing if.not.comical I guess many found it hard to.believe Christmas in Paris turned nightmare according to Scene #1 I guess some critics saw it as being brutal to adults Kevin's parents were doling out punishment to him the night before their trip It is definitely playing on a kids point of view but I tbought it was entertaininf for adukt Aduk L Sorry adults Imagine you are flying on the airplane and find out your kid is missing! That is true fear A parent would have to feel totally helpless Yeah and only to find out all return flights are booked.. It seems like they spent alot of money on special effects Well I don't remember the special effects but they must have been very seamless It seems like Kevin was happy to be alone at first The duo Harry and Marv are wreaking havoc in the neighborhood :p I would be scared to death if robbers were after me and I was a kid at home alone Pretty smart kid isn't he? But he gets hep from Marley!

hello Hello. Going to be talking about Real Steel today. It's a sci-fi movie with Hugh Jackman taking the lead role of Charlie Kenton. I've never seen it whatas it about It's about a man who fights robots. cool when does it take place I guess I should explain better, he controls a robot that fights other (sort of like boxing, but with people controlling robots). is it like a futuristic movie Somewhat, yes.  I mean besides that there deosn't seem to be much futuristic about it. It takes place in 2020. cool okay do you like it
lol how old are you ? i am 38 and yes i do live with my mom ? i am starting an internship next week do you live with your dad too ? o my dad left us when i was five , my mother raised me since then

Some days I wish I could be sedated and travel years constructing memories. that would be really cool Haha I agree! Sounds fun! I didnt understand why Mal committed suicide to wake up, did you? No, some of the concepts, while mind-blowing, were still confusing to me. yes, maybe its something I need to watch again Same here! If it really has been 8 years, then I haven't seen that movie since 8 years ago! I forgot about the totem, would definitely be necessary in that kind of world, shame Mal didnt have it to know what was a dream vs reality That'd be a terrifying situation to be in. Not being able to distinguish reality from a dream. The movie definitely played on our reality a bit... you know sometimes you have a dream and you wake up and are unsure if its real for a minute Has that evr happened to you? Oh yes! Quite a few times! so out of 10 how would you rate the movie? Based on my 8-year memory, probably a high 8 or 9. Who knows though, maybe after a rewatch, it could be a 10 for me. So, my 'finish conversation' button lit up. Is our work done here? If so, it has been a pleasure chatting with you!

That sounds a little like Frozen Is it? It is! You've heard of it, then? It sounds to me like it's worth seeing. I have indeed You haven't seen it? I have. I loved it.
I must reiterate that I'm not please with this movie as a whole. The emphasis on fraternaties and the need to fit in just to graduate is frustrating.

That's ironic. haa I loved that Alfred (the butler) becomes a key character by raising Bruce Yeah, that was good how he took him in. I remember him from the others. I love the scenes where Bruce is training with the League of Shadows! Is there a lot of action in this movie? I'd recommend watching it to see that When Bruce burns down the temple there is definitely a lot of action there Interesting. I think I'll give it a shot. Do you usually watch movies based of their ratings? Most of the time. I like pretty much anything. what about you? Same, this movie seemed to get good ratings Does scene 3 interest you I like the the way the plot continuously evolves. Yeah it does. I like the mixture of action and the story of how things happened. I agree, there's enough action to keep you entertained and enough backstory to keep you from getting confused. The performance of Christian Bale was spot on in this movie I am sure I will like this movie now. Would it be good for kids to watch? Based off the scenes I read I think it should be okay for kids, perhaps a little violent
ll that to my string of exes xes should not matter anymore but i understand where you are coming from . i cannot tell you how many i have but they all ended up very badly i have a hard time socializing never know what to say . but it all works out i tend to make friends on the soccer field easily
what is your favorite kind of music ? i like electronic and classical music .
Yes. It was good. I love the name "League of Shadows." It's so immaterial.
lso , i am a little sad w i am sorry to hear that i hope you feel better i did not get accepted into the gifted program at my school ! well when i am faced with troubles , i pray . works for me do you ? maybe i will try that ! ver a bad idea . do you read often ?
It is in 7 OK. I do not remember watching it. Can you tell me more about this movie? Next i like Thriller movie OK. Can you tell me more aboutit? OK i like conjuring movie very much I would like to watch one. But I am kind of need more information towards that. In this movie is some murder case and so there is some thriller movie Can you advise anything, please? Is there anything else you can tell me? Have you seen Goos Bump
she plays the villain then becomes the heroine
wow , that sounds interesting ! i am going to go practice guitar for a while . what kind of music do you play ? i love folk music . oo , but mostly i play jazz , usually bass . what did you make ? i made a jewelry box as a gift for my sisters birthday next month . she will be 35 . hat sounds like a really nice gift . after that , i will probably go out for dinner . where will you go for dinner ? i really like dim sum , but they only have it here on sunday , so probably thai food . sounds good . i love thai food . i do not like fast food , so i will have to go into the city .
I really liked the supporting cast, too. I don't have much experience with del Toro, but I'll be looking for his works in the future. What was your favorite moment of the film? For me, it was the ending. Very thought-provoking. Favorite moment? Perhaps the getting to know each other. I liked how her muteness added to the relationship, rather than inhibited it. Did you find her muteness added to the storyline? The whole "difference isn't bad" was important. That seems key in a lot of sci-fi, of which I'm a fan. Yes, it made her different from the rest of society just like he was also different from other people. They were both outcasts in a way, which made their connection stronger since they could understand each other like no one else had ever tried. The supporting cast were also somewhat outcast. The bad guy didn't fit either What other del Toro films would you recommend? I think all of them are very good. Which one of the supporting cast was your favorite?
Yup. Sometimes things aren't what they seem. I guess in a way she was a "wolf in sheep's clothing." Who knew a little carrot pen would save the day Ha, yes! Bunnyburrow is such a cute name for a town It is. I'm a sucker for punny/cutesy names in things like this. Me too.  The little mice mobsters.  lol I wonder if they'll make a second one. I know it was really popular. I hope they do.  The ratings were great! They probably will. It is Disney after all, hehe. True.  They like to run with themes. Hopefully Judy Hopps and her Fox friend will remain besties in any sequels.  It's a great message for kids to see people with so many differences be such great friends. Oh yeah. Didn't he join the squad at the end? That's a perfect jumping off point for a sequel. Oh ya!  I had forgotten about that! I can't wait to see what happens next. I liked that he knew her true character and forgave her rather quickly for what she said. It's been nice chatting with you about the Zootopia movie Yes, same! Hope you have a good day. ^_^ To you as well. Hopefully we will hear that a sequel to Zootopia is being made soon.
i am a girl . short , fat , with brown hair i love short fat girls . we would get along then ! tell me you love cats too cats are cool , but i like them to stay away from my chinchilla .
I have not heard of this. What genre? yeah, it's a historical political triller "historical/political hmmm. any famous actors or actresses? yeah, Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks The movie was written by Liz Hannah and Josh Singer Ok I think I actually have seen the face cover of the movie. I use Fmovies a lot. Now I have netflix. So good ratings or bad? Well I would say good ratings, Rotten tomatoes;88% CinemaScore;A Metacritic"83/100 sounds like good ratings. so the ratings from the group attests it is a movie to watch Is it a long movie, decent length, or short? It is about Journalists trying to publish what is regarded as classified by the government Based on the review would you watch it? I would say long, though I don't remember the run time but the fact that it is a 2017 movie but having the 1970's set makes it intriguing.\ That is quite interesting. Is it in anyway musical? Graham sees publishing the story as something that could tanish the long standing family legacy if they lose the court case or it could propel the newspaper to a higher pedestal, she eventually decided to publish the story I do like both the leading actors in the movie. SOunds like something I might have to check out Not at all musical, you know war situations Yes definitely, haha had to ask to make sure, however. The movie says a lot about the vietnam war actually you need to do that and besides it is more or less a recent movie\ 2017 to be precise You got to go see it one of this days lest I forget let me run you through the cast again so you can decide better Meryl Streep, Tom Hanks, Sarah Paulson, Bob Odenkirk and many more yes I agree. i don't go to theaters though. Too much money. I either find it on the netflix or find it online Good deal dude Sarah Paulson any relation to Robert Paulson? I am not too sure, maybe because it wasn't stated in the movie catch you later
i am scared and i cant sleep superman can protect you he is my favorite .
His name sounds familiar but I don't know him maybe if I see a picture I would know who he was Yeah, the second act gets pretty crazy when his company's weapons are being used to attack villages. Stane has been trafficking criminals worldwide and wants to replace stark Wow and the plot gets deeper He does save the villagers go Stark! Yeah it does. Later Pepper Pots meets with the SHIELD Agent and tells him abot some undercover plans going on Yeah Stane is pretty bad
lucky you . do you have a big family ? i do not , but i have a bunch of friends hat is good . i wish i had many friends . i will be your friend , do you like cats ? yes , i do . and thanks ! what do you want to do when you grow up ? i do not know moms teaching dads working in the mill . . . . . well , what do you like ? sports ? science ? i really have to say cats and dogs
Honestly, it's been so many years since I rewatched it that I don't remember it well enough to recall the suspense I felt during that scene. The Amity Island scene has to be the most memorable in the movie to me, aside from Jaws jumping onto the boat to get Quint.

it sure can be . i wish it could help the poor more though . what do you do for work ? i am a programmer . my dream is to save the world one app at a time .
No i haven't It's a sci-fi movie and i don't typically watch those Not sure it's that good. It has a score of 59% on Rotten Tomatoes. That's what I was thinking also Actually, I kind of like sci-fi, but I'm picky. Yes I can agree with that it depends for me This one sounds more like an action flick in a sci-fi setting. ah that would make sense it also has sports? I thought more sci-fi because it was also a twilight zone episode But the "Rocky with Robots" line makes me doubt that I would like it. I didnt catch that but I'm with you I've never seen any Rocky's either And I didn't know it was a Twilight Zone episode. Ha! Me neither. Haven't seen the Rocky movies. That's kind of odd to me i feel like most everyone has seen them The premise of this one is not so stupid though. Robot boxers. I feel it could become real at some point. Rocky? Yeah I know, it was such a big movie. But Stallone has never done anything for me. No kidding I don't like any movies of his This Real Steel movie has Hugh Jackman in it. He's not bad. But I don't mind Hugh Jackman Haha we're thinking the same thing Exactly. He looks like he has quite a few more IQ points than Sylvester. And he's better looking haha Not difficult :-) We're losing track of Real Steel though It sounds as though this is pretty predictable as well and I like movies that I can't guess the end The whole Real Steel story seems like a series of machinations of bad guys against good guys, without much else. Same here. This one sounds like it's been written by committee. Right I do like that it's a a family movie- I don't have kids but I feel like it would be ok for my nephew
its fun but can be an expensive hobby

Did you find it difficult to follow the plot at all? At times but the build up is good and you learn about it at a pace that I was able to follow it but I have since watched it multiple more times just to catch the little things I missed. Cool. I am a fan of Christopher Nolan so I think it will be worth it. Snippet: The team takes Fischer and a wounded Sailo to a warehouse, where Cobb reveals that while dying in the dream would normally wake Sailo up, the powerful sedatives needed to stabilize the multi-level dream will instead send a dying dreamer into limbo, a world of infinite subconscious and escaping the dream is difficult as is an is now even more difficult. That sounds really enjoyable. Is the cast good? Actor reveals to actor that he and actor went to limbo while experimenting with the dreamsharing tech.  Sedated for a few hours of real time, they spent fifty years in a dream constructing a world from their shared memories.  Trying not to spoil much hehe. Leonardo Decaprio is a fantastic actor so he is obviously good and the rest I would rate as playing their role very well.
hat is too bad . mystery flavored cake is really good .

Exactly Kristen bell did it when she was grown I'm shocked Metacritics only gave it a score of 74/100 but rotten tomatoes 89% Yes that was a surprise for me I would rate it 95% how about you? I would give it the same. Key scene that did it for me is when Elsa accidently displays her powers Duke deems her a monster, when he shouldn't Yes that was a bad part for me , made me so emotional It was a route part, but she gets to build her own ice palace The critics said it has the best animated musical since the death of howard Yep it just plain terrific family entertainment

Hi! So what did you think of the 1990 comedy Home Alone? Hello. I like it. It's very interesting and hilarious to me seeing Joe Pesci in a movie like this since I know him form the more serious movies he did. Very true! He nailed the role of Harry! All of the actors did! Was he your favorite actor in the film? Macaulay Culkin is my favorite in the movie. It was so fun just watching him outsmart 2 grown men. Agreed! He was my favorite as well! I can't help but agree with CinemaScore's rating of A as that would be the rating I'd give the film as well! Yes this is a christmas classic and deserves an A rating. I feel the critic that described the movie as having an implausible plot is taking the movie more seriously than the creators of the movie intended it to be. Very well said! Some of the critics were out of their minds. Especially the one you described as well as the one who called the first half "flat and unsurprising". Yes I found the first half very entertaining. I haven't seen this movie in a little wow I might go back and watch it I feel you! So hard to believe it was released in 1990! I like the quote "sadistic festival of adult-bashing". Between's Kevin's parents forgetting him and the burglars this movie doesn't make adult looks too bright.

I think they might realize that their audience isn't going to be a bunch of jazz heads, so Sebastian (the one who wants to save Jazz, played by Gosling) is playing a 1980s pop band cover, so there's still some variety.
sick sick i am reading the hobbit now do you enjoy fantasy novels ? my mom works at the library so i read a lot yea i read them all myself ! ice . what do you do for fun ? well i run a lot and take care of my dogs you
So today we are discussing the move The Avengers that was released in 2012.  Have you seen it? I haven't. What's it about? Have you seen it? The Avengers is an American superhero film.  The characters come from various Marvel Comic books.  Are you familiar with Marvel comics? Oh sorry, yes I have seen it Somewhat. Are there any  big stars in it that I might know? The film stars such recognizable stars as Robert Downey Jr, Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johannsson, Jeremy Renner, Tom Hiddleston and Samuel L Jackson Oh cool! I know a lot of them. Sounds good so far. Did the movie get good reviews? The movie got overall good reviews.  While some cited it as being a little familiar or formulaic, in general the film was found to be very entertaining.  The performances of Robert Downey Junior and Mark Ruffalo were noted as exceptional Interesting. What's the basic plot? Who are they fighting? The basic plot is that all of these superheroes are recruited to fight Loki who is intent on taking over the world.  Loki has stolen a powerful artifact and is using its powers to battle the forces of Earth. This isn't a sequel to another movie, is it? I mean, can I jump right into this or will I be confused if I haven't seen the previous movies (if there are any)? There are 5 movies prior to this one so it may be a little tricky jumping right into this one.  It is mostly enjoyable on its own but to get the full flavor of the movie, you'd want to see the 5 movies that were made prior to it.
I love Robert Downey Jr. So Tony Stark is Iron Man? He crafts a suit that turns him into a superhero Oh neat! I bet his ability to make weapons helps with making a superhero suit He is indeed, sort of like a Bruce Wayne/Batman deal It does, turns him into a living weapon, of sorts What makes Iron Man different from Batman? Is it just the suit that sets them apart?
i hope to impart some of my knowledge to grandkids . what shows do you watch on bbc ? oh , that one about the nosy neighbor .
No, I haven't seen that one yet.  Is it good?
hank you god . finally someone does .
what thoughts do you have about the pool boy ? do you fancy him ? he is quite pleasant to look at ve you talked to him about this ? i do not think so . . . . i do tend to hear some voices that remind me of him
you sound like a good dad . i do not have kids yet . just school and watch tv . what is your favorite tv show ?
would be a nice change from all those dark and apocalyptic movies I love seeing perspective of people who lived through historical events. This one looks like it takes place during the 1970s during the Vietnam War. Yes, I love historical dramas as well! Very interesting to immerse in time that was before us It seems that this movie also makes it easy to understand the event and characters based on the quality of the movie. Yes, the actors did a great job depicting these events, I'm sure The ratings also look great. Rotten Tomatoes is a site i use often to check movies. It got an 88% so that's descent. Yes, not too bad at all, I'm definitely sold I don't see anything about where you can get the movie from. I wonder if it's available to stream?
you have no idea? yes then ok this page cannot be moved for limited time
i would not , my dogs would though . i would rather swim instead of a boat . yes . i have husky , and i would rather play with my nintendo . husky dogs are cute . i have four dogs and four toes on my left foot . what happened to your fifth toe ?
Great how was the movie? Im doing ok, a bit under the weather but alive...lol God bless! Did you like the movie? Well according to rotten tomatoes it only scored 48%, have you seen this show? What was it about? I have seen it, I enjoyed it, It is a comedy directed by Tom Shadyac. Who played in this film? Jim Carrey plays a man named Bruce Nolan, and Morgan Freeman plays God What happened in this film? Jennifer Annistanis also in it and plays bruces girlfriend interest What is the plot of this movie? So bruce is a news reporter with hopes of becoming an anchor, but is not seen as mature by co workers Jim plays as Bruce who is a news reporter ? He plans to become a news anchor? He suffers from chronic bad luck, and he breaks when he is passed up for a job by his rival evan baxter Haha So what happens next? ? So he somehow finds God and is given powers of from god because he does nothing but complain to him how he isnt doing his job right..God isnt, so bruce now has god powers Wow! So Bruce finds God? And he was given power? So Bruce finds all these different ways to make miraculous events occur so that he can cover the news story What happens to his girlfriend? What did she say? he starts to hear voices and finds out it is peoples prayers, so he starts answering those prayers and all lets loose
i want some ice cream ice cream ! ice cream is good . what kind do you like ? i like vanilla !
i will thank you ! any kids yet ?
Now there is a Russian weapon trafficker involved who has dealings with LexCorp. It sounds a bit complicated. I was wondering how any human could possibly be a match for him Haha.. yeah good point! It seems Luthor plays a big role in this film. That's already a couple characters too many in my opinion Yeah I'm struggling to follow how they're all connected to each other lol But after reading it I want to watch it because I don't like being confused lol And here, Luxor kidnaps Clark's adoptive mother.. as if picking on Lois wasn't enough
i teach grades 6 8 you see
but that is always the coolest part is the traps and him setting them up
what is wrong ? are the teachers bullying you ? o but the kids at my school are . i am in high school and worry about money you should talk to someone about it . you can talk to me , friend i have and nobody will listen , i am listening . what is wrong ?
That's a funny nickname haha oh yeah. expecially for an assassin i didn't even know new york city has a "little russia" - i guess that's in the movie, too And a church as hiding place? God sees you though haha If you believe in him atleast,which they probably don't lol. not sure if that's better or worse than the "safe house" where the guy gets killed. There's a little of every country in NY I guess lol Yea,not much of a safe house viggo must have been a pretty bad guy with all of that blackmail material I mean it's a movie,but one guy killing hundreds of people? He's no saint for sure haha lots of torture before the execution sometimes, too Why are they always escaping by helicopters lol lol. can't be a good action movie without a helicopter! I guess so haha i love that there's a dog in this movie, but that puppy was the saddest part And some puppies apparently yes pit bull puppy! Well he saved one at least at the end thankfully. he couldn't get his wife helen back but at least he got a new puppy.
i use to draw a lot , but most of my free time goes to my daughter cool . i like to play music sometimes . i just bought a mixer . oh cool what genre you listen to ? i am all about reggae . i be jammin . what about you ? i listen to a little of everything depending on the artist but mainly rap and hip hop

I have seen it, it was not very good.  I think you have some bad information.
hi Have you seen The Wolf of Wall Street? oh, man, have i Definitely not for everyone, but I enjoyed it. RT gives it a 78, but in my mind it's a solid 83 or 84 I like to see stuff like this from Scorsesi rather than Huggo or other stuff he's done modernly.
I have heard of Keira Knightley, I liked the Disney Pirate moves with Jack Sparrow. She played in all the movies. Good actress. I am surprised you have not heard of her.
yeah i like him too ive never seen superman His one of my favorites as well but Batman is my #1 superhero then its saysluthor kidnaps lois lane and martha kent and luthor demands that superman kill batman Oh I see, and what happens next Sounds interesting batman fights superman and then superman pleads w him to save martha batman rescues martha and sm confronts luthor And what about the director of the film? luthor is arrested Oh, so Luthor gets caught batman says to luthor that he will always be watching him
he rock and roll hall of fame , hike , sports , cedar point , etc
THE COMMUTER MOVIE IS VERY NICE yes yes whats your name dude MY NAME IS VIJAY Neeson, of course, is superb as the ex-cop-turned-insurance salesman, who finds himself caught in an incredible web of lies and deceit. where are u from india While development for the film began in 1996, Jenkins signed on to direct in 2015. Principal photography began on November 21, 2015, with filming taking place in the United Kingdom, France, and Italy before wrapping up on May 9, 2016, the 123rd anniversary of the birth of the creator, William Moulton Marston. Additional filming took place in November 2016. The team learns a gala will be held at the nearby German High Command. Steve and Diana separately infiltrate the party, with Steve intending to locate the gas and destroy it, while Diana intends to kill Ludendorff, believing that he is Ares and thus killing him will end the war. yes yes when you see this movie? yes i see the movie which character would you like more?
oh yeah one of the best directors of all time he makes amazing movies and this is one of them I'm in awe of the fact that he was able to steal over 2 million dollars by pretending to be other people!~ That is some serious, albeit scary, skill! yeah at at the age of 16 i believe he did all that very smart to be able to do everything he did and get away with it for so long he wastrying to not be like his parents losing there house he acted as a teacher at the age of 16 and he pulled it off and like it says when he ran out of money he became someone else and scams people very smart for being so young
i am to young to help you . i enjoy listening to bruno mars has always been a dream of mine to own a restaurant , i like pink floyd i have this thing where i just want to sleep when i am not cooking my hobby is running running is a good thing to do . i normally walk . walking is great also , i really enjoy being the head grill man re you in the navy o , i use to be in the army oh ok , there is a difference yes there is a big difference , between the two what else do you do ?
yes, yes it was, and it's beautiful .... it's from a B classification I wasn't sure if I would enjoy it or not myself but especially my daughter. I didn't know if it was too hard for her to understand. w Where does the story take place? Is it Gotham City or somewhere else? both cities are present in the movie the movie is 18 months after the movie of the man of steel
hi ! i love yellow . it is a happy color ! what is yours ? ine is green ! what kind of music do you like ? i love rock ! guitars are awesome ! i actually teach piano in my music class . oh cool ! ! that is awesome , do you do anything else for work ? o because i am up early , have my coffee and work until 5 . i see , makes sense , i hate my job , mcdonalds . it pays the bills though

Is it historically accurate? Yes, it depicts ww2 in the 1940's. And it's still in theatres? I am not sure about that, but did you know the movie was shot on IMAX 65mm and 65mm large Kind of like his last film. Nice. Ok, I am interested.
i want to show my league proud n make state
i love the acting that Leonardo  dicaprio. thos in every one of his movies Yeah I believe he should have gotten his first Oscar a long time ago! its the one where that the end the chinsis guy goes extremly deep into the dreamworld and getts trapped or akmost dies in the dream for some time Yeah those special effects have held up quite well! Very visually twisting
i paint at times and for some reason i have to hear pink songs . i love the band one direction . ood choice my wife listens to them while she cooks the best pasta ever .
OHH SORRY THN the budget of this movie is only $9 million OK and Box officecollection is $470.7 million... GREAT this is a Blockbuster at the time,... gr8 movie YES tell me about you something...
I've got the document this time so would you like to hear about a movie? Haha Yes I'd love to! What's the move called? *movie Have you heard of the film Batman Begins? Yes! Have you seen it? Yes, although it's been a few years since I've watched it
meh. depends on the criteria we're judging it by. there are big names in it, who are good actors, and the concept is interesting, but ultimately I would say it's not a life changing movie which is what I would need for an A rating
oh cool i like to play video games in my free time ! ice we have beer and tons of food cool i love food . i am overweight a bit but healthy do you like any sports ?
yes , 10 to date ! do you like grateful dead ? when they toured i followed them . oh okay and no . i breed cats for fun . you have a cat ?
I had never known about penny stocks before this movie.  There was the scene where he joins that Long Island firm that dealt with those. Yeah, it was all new information to me as well. It was kind of hard to see the line where Leo went from being a really good Penny Stock Salesman, to a fraudster. Yeah just crazy how they got into sex and drugs and the crazy lifestyle.    I hadn't heard of Black Monday either. Yeah, still a little uncertain on that one haha. I will say this though, He deserved better than his previous career. However I just wish he hadn't done all those bad things. But I guess that's why its a movie right It's just crazy that he had a business partner and a wife and was still leading this whole crazy career.  It was also kind of crazy to imagine that this all started in 1987.

They go into people's minds to steal information. yes Even Ellen Page is in it, and I love her. i also love her The people who go into other people's minds are called extractors. yes It has an 86% on Rotten Tomatoes, so that's pretty good. yes The first scene kind of explains how going in someone's mind works. In a team, people have to set up "kicks" to wake each other up from sleeping (how they go into a mind, I guess). But some people have defenses in their subconsciousness, and the team gets attacked in one guy's mind. If the guy dies will in another person's mind, he may get stuck in an infinite limbo where he forgets he's dreaming. You're a very slow typist considering how exciting this movie is. If the guy dies will in another person's mind, he may get stuck in an infinite limbo where he forgets he's dreaming

Hello Hi So the movie we're talking about is Inception Have you seen it? What is the movie about? I haven't seen it The movie is a scientific movie about people who infiltrate the subconscious of individuals and obtain information in the dream world. Basically they enter into someone's dreams to find out information.

As far as I am concern, I did not like the movie much ah I have to watch a lot of kids movies so this has to be one of the ones I can tolerate. it has that whole "you can do whatever you want to do " mentality, like a rabbit wanting to be a cop... I like animated movies and even I do some animation but this movie is not very good I think my kids like it cause it had multiple animals in it The funny thing was when he got parking ticket job right, good old rookie position Thats right What about other charecters? You remember any of them ? i remember the fox had that little friend, he dressed like a baby and they sold like popsicles Yaah right they were scammers Yaah what about toxic flowers? not sure what that is. is that from the movie? What about when judy got access to traffic camera? oh yeah, I remember that slightly do you like Bellwether charecter? oh there we go , its talking about toxis flowers I like bellwether character, a sheep lol, shes cute
Hello hello I have seen this film. Even though I don't usually go for musicals this one was pretty good. Looks like it is rated pretty well on the various sites too. i also saw the movie and i had bigger expectations when i saw the cast It says it was shot in "CinemaScope", I wonder what that is i don't either but at least the idea of the movie was great The last couple reviews are a bit harsh, but I can kinda agree. It is a little difficult to not bring outside information into this conversation. yea but it's a jazz movie after jazz became unpopular so it's kinda realistic True isn't this thing supposed to give us more info to chat about as we go? yea Who is your favorite actor/actress in this film? they kind of boat are they have a good chemistry Ya, that is probably what made the film a hit. Speaking of chemistry, new info finally popped up about when they first sorta hit if of off These descriptions kinda make Sebastian sound like an ass with a real chip on his shoulder yea
very nice , how much do you make a year ?
Thankfully she escaped! No kidding since Hans had ordered Elsa's execution.
i have a house on a farm i have many . i wish i could get me an bella lillies

very weekend he has to watch a movie for harry potter
you must have super sonic vision if you can watch tv and mosquitoes at the same time . pizza will solve every problem in life , you understand ? yes and mosquitoes will give you zika and you will turn into a mermaid too . i saw what you will be in the future , non existent ! fter a 12 pack of beer you will believe mermaids are real like i do . peanut butter goes well with bread and crackers yes peanut butter , crackers , baseball , apple pis and my best friend , mom .

wonderful i wish i could do that
I think so, but I'm not that sure It's kind of exciting. Leo plays a con-artist that learns very early on who to pose as other people ok, that sounds cool. And Hanks? he started early in high school and then does confidence game type scams, eventually forging Pan Am checks Yes, he shows up in the middle of the movie I think What is he playing? sorry abotu that!
i am fine thanks . its always fun to talk with new people ! it is ! so what do you do for work ? just a boring job . do you do something interesting ? i am a nurse . i would rather be a professional eater but not get fat doing it .
It had a really great score on CinemaScore too when both of those scores match that usually means its a great score or movie But, it looks like it got a bad rating on Metacritic Oh well, I think cinemascore is the most important because it involves fans Are there a lot of special effects in the film? Not really, its mostly a thriller or drama that takes place in one building That sounds pretty interesting. It's a low key movie yes, its a little slow but good Did you see it in theaters in 2014?
do you think you could tell by looking at someone what they eat ? do you like tea ? i love it . i love tea . i went vegan only a year ago . i love veggies and fruit .
hat would be good . i am still young 22 . i also hope they can cook gourmet meals but not have my fear of open spaces
very nice ! i thought about it , then was offered a scholarship to a dance school oh , that is good . it is hard . . . .

wayyyyy back in 1990! no kidding!  now i feel old Me too! I sitll can't believe that they accidentally leave their youngest son behind! yeah, even though they made everyone look so busy, they really should've did more headcounts before reaching the plance. whoops, plane i mean. It's pretty funny. I guess they needed that bit for the movie to happen in the first place! it does set up the rest of the movie.  of course no one notices except the mom. haha go figure! It is still a cute and slapstick movie, though! One critic called it a "sadistic festival of adult-bashing". :D HA!  guess i find adult-bashing to be hilarious.  especially when the bad guys make such funny faces, and they deserve it, robbing people at christmas time.  horrible! Right? I agree! I had forgotten that the mom DOES try to get back to him, but she ends up getting waylaid at every turn! I love when she ends up with the travelling polka band yes, it's pretty funny when she's stuck in that van with some weird band. Jinx! LOL.  polka, right! doesn't she go thru a bunch of stuff only to get home at the same time as the rest of the family?
Do you like the style of the movie? how the animation was created? If I really like the style I like the style as well. It was such an upgrade from the old disney style (to 1995)
i love it , i think it is perfect , you ? he weather , i hope finally cooled off . its been hot here . i do not like the heat at all .
i like a lot of foods

i like the way he says the word vowel .
Yeah, the story's message is applicable to people of all ages. And the comedic side characters, Olaf and the reindeer were pretty fun. Do you watch many Disney movies?  I have but I don't always like them, Frozen was a bit different from their usual.  Loved Olaf! I think I have watched all of the 3D computer animated Disney movie. I found all of them very well done. I mean their ratings are always very good. I think it was around 2013 when Disney moved from 2D animation to 3D. I wonder how the Broadway version will/does compare to the movie.  I have seen Elsa redone in other venues so I am guessing the recreation will be great.  I hope it captures the emotion of the movie. I do really like Broadway musicals. It is just that it you can do a lot of cool effect in 3D, but on Broadway, it has to be all practical effects.
Yeah. Revenge would be a good reason for some people. They stole his car and killed his puppy, a gift from the dead wife. Wow. Thats bad. I hate torture in movies though Yeah. Its very unpleasent.
i stay put here and help on the farm . been in the family for generations .

Yes, it is. What else can you tell me about it? Without giving away the ending please! At first, it's a rocky start because the rabbit girl is a cop. And the fox? He's a con artist. Oh, of course. A rabbit cop? That's silly! Yeah, but she's determined. But of course the fox would be a con artist! Even one animal can make a difference. I like that as a catch phrase. So based on the movie, it's all about animals in clothes, like us people. Huh. That's pretty cool!
hi Hello! I am going to be talking to you about a movie called The Blind Side. The Blind Side is a biographical sports film based on a book about a football player names Michael Oher (played by Quinton Anton). The film features Sandra Bullock and Tim McGraw as adoptive parents Sean and Leigh Anne Tuohy. was it a good movie ? Overlal, the film received positive reviews, but critics praised Sandra Bullock's performance. Critics talked about how strong the source material and Sandra Bullock's performance were.Other actors include Jaw Head as Sean Tuohy Jr. and Lily Collins as Collins Tuohy. isnt tim mcgraw a country music singer ? I believe so, but in this film he is one of the featured cast members. who directed the movie The director was John Lee Hancock. The film was released in 2009.

hi hello so lets talk about iron man? alright did you see it? yeah did you like it? yes i did me too what did you like the most?
That's really cool. If you want to find the book it's called Alan Turing: The Enigma, it's written by Andrew Hodges. I believe it was also made into a play. And I must say that Keira Knightly was not only a very attractive presence in the movie but also gave a very good performance! Who did she play again? I forgot. She was the young woman who applied to work in the lab and then blew them away with her performance on the entry test. It was really sad to see Christopher Morcom die so suddenly from tuberculosis. That scene was so hearbreaking.
hat is awsome . do they watch sesame street ? ope . jt all day . my boys are gonna be pop stars . i actually was one of the first test children chosen for that show . lol ice . watch they hate me and study calculus all day . whatever . . . what do you do for a living ? mom . i have a horse . my husband is a businessman .

They like such movies. You know action, super hero types Then I guess I should give this film a try. I think you will like it a lot. And then you can watch the sequels. Well, it's been nice talking to you. Same here. I hope you have a nice evening.

somewhere sunny to help with my issues . trying to break out of my shell you will get there , just keep connecting with people with common interests . hank you . it is great to feel like people care . you seem caring .
I like comedies but I am a bit old for the high school theamed movies who plays the roles? Lindsay Lohan is the main character. Rachel McAdams plays a lead character as well. Does she play a positive or a negative character? What's you fevorite part of the movie? Lindsay's character starts by trying to fit with the 'plastics' but then she plans revenge on them. I better like SiFi movies This movie is definitely not sci-fi but if you're looking for a good cliche laugh about revenge and high school this would be the one to watch OK, may be sometime when I have nothing else to do. What other movies could you recomend? Right now just mean girls. Do you like movies based on their rating? Do you mean user ratings or PG type of ratings? No. Like when I'm looking for movies sometimes I'll look at rotten tomatoes to see what they have rated a movie Yes, I check the ratings but often such ratings does not agree with me - a lot of movies highly rated on rotten tomatoes were plane boring I agree. Mean Girls is rated at 6.9 out of 10. But i probably would have rated it a 4. My favorite part of the movie is when one guy yells out 'she doesnt even go here'. Many ratings are boosted by producing companies, I think This is very true I agree with you on that. It is funny when adult people play kids in the movies, some of the actors are in late twenties I agree I always had that thought. Especially because Rachel Mcadams was fairly old when the movie came out. And so is Lindsay Lohan. Mentally, Lohan is still a highschooler, I think But it'll be nice if casting was more realistic, maybe it'll open a door forsome new young talents
hank you so much ! i would love to . staying home more to practice would be nice ! yeah it is not easy when certain things in life gets in the way
i there , how are you ? ot bad , how are you ? i am good , just enjoying a sewing project i am doing for a few friends . hat sounds cool , but not sure i would have enough patience for it ! i enjoy it . i put on some katy perry and its like therapy katy perry has some good tunes for running , that is what i like doing i like to run with my friends sometimes . what else do you enjoy ? watching movies . my favorite is 16 candles . have you seen it ? i have seen it ! classic . you like to hunt ?

I haven't seen the movie. I really want to see it though. Have you heard the music? Idina Menzel sings the part of Elsa. Maybe I have. Is Elsa the main character? Elsa is one of the main cast members. The others are Anna, her younger sister, and Kristoff, an iceman. I think I've seen Kristoff. What country does the movie take place in? A kingdom called Arendelle Is that a ficitonal country?

Hi! Did you like the movie? What is the title again? The Avengerd Can you remind me who were the headlining stars? Sorry Avengers with Robert Downey Jr, Samuel L Jackson , Chris Hemsworth, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, and Jeremy Renner Oh, I remember it now. It was sort of a sci-fi movie, right? Yes it includes some of the Marvel comic book characters like Iron Man, the Hulk, Thor, and Captain America I always like these types of movies. I liked Iron Man and Thor so I watched this one. I thought it would be cool if all of these heroes came together in one movie. This one was just about as good as I thought it would be. Yes I liked it. Love all the main actors. Yeah, me too. I think the cast was well chosen. Ok I'm lost... wasn't that three paragraphs? Now I have a different document. Stand by. ok Ok it is a detailed message about the main scenes, contains a lot of other bad guy characters, and I think it's just page 2. Now what. I reread the tasks and it says three paragraphs with four people and the page will come up automatically. Can you check again under Tasks on the bottom? My tasks just says it is a conversation with one person. My instructions says I have to make 12 responses. Three responses to four people. If you click strategies next to send message, it says what to ask. I'm going to find one to ask you. Brb Do you agree with the ratings of this movie?

I also enjoy movies that mess with your mind, or give you something you weren't expecting. Yeah, I'm pretty sure we're done. Me too.  The more unexpected, the better!
Let me read first ok It is about an action movie John Wick. oh nice who is the lead actor Keanu Reeves, he is really good. he is really dead pan in this film i love that guy he never ages..his first movie i saw was matrix whats the rating of the movie? He is playing a ex-hit man in this film, the rating was 6.9/10 on metecritic and 86% on rotten tomatoes quite low though ..but at least its not less than 5 i usually don't watch a movie if its rating is below 5 It is a divisive movie, some liked it some hated it, the plot is really simple, russian mafia kills John's Wick puppy, he takes revenge on them The first part is about describing how badass is John Wick. sweet from what u have read do u think u will watch it? Yes, it is like a western movie, the plot maybe lacking but the action sequences are really good. The second we see Jon Wick in action, he tries to kill the guy who kill his puppy in a nightclub. ewww...i dont like movies with blood killing a puppy is just too much but then its a movie ..hahaha That why he is taking revenge. It one action scene after another. A fight in a nightclub, in a Hotel room, then in a church which serve as a front for the russian mafia it sounds really action packed who is d director? Chad Stahelski and David Leitch wow quite unpopular but they seem to have conquered the US market for them to get a rating of 6.8 for this movie
i see . virginia . john and wayne are my brothers . you dance ? i do . less you call reeling in a fish dancing ! i do not . oh okay . i married my husband quickly . he is vegan too . you teach fishing ? o . i just really enjoy it . were you highschool sweethearts ? o . train riders . i wear a lab coat too . you cook fish ?

Oh, okay. that is true when does the hero not win in disney movies! do you think there will be a second movie? Apparently the sisters' parents die in a sea storm! How terrible. And very Disney. I think there might be. Critics seemed to love it If Disney can make more money off of something then they're gonna do it. I totally like that thinking! It was written to move directly to Broadway it seems, so there's another cash cow! so since this movie is a disney movie, im assuming its okay to show to all ages? I believe so Do you think you would watch it, even as an adult? who stars in the movie in terms of the voices for there character I think I would watch it, I love watching disney movies! Kristen Bell voices 18 year old Anna, Idina Menzel is Elsa, and Jonathan Groff voices Kristoff (Anna's friend) I am not really familiar with any of those names. do you think this movie is full of action?
i kind of do seeing my family is a mixture of so much , you ? i do not if my family is mixed or not , we never talked about that i am a rican an chinese , from over seas but not from there lol hat is a really interesting mix ! do you have children or family ? really ? doctors never ask ? oh

Would you like to hear about a key moment in this spectacular movie? Yes!

When Frank Sr. is denied a business loan atChase Manhattan Bank due to unknown difficulties with the IRS, the family is forced tomove from their large home to a small apartment. Paula carries on an affair with Jack, afriend of her husband. Meanwhile, Frank poses as a substitute teacher in his French class.Frank's parents file for divorce, and Frank runs away. When he runs out of money, hebegins relying on confidence scams to get by. Soon, Frank's cons increase and he evenimpersonates an airline pilot. He forges Pan Am payroll checks and succeeds in stealingover $2.8 million. Nice plot right? What do you think of Leonardo DiCarpio as Frank?

i am just sitting at home with my puppy well what do you know , hotdogs are my favorite snack . you are mean you should not say that ctually i was wordplaying with you . birdwatchers are never mean spirited . what kind of birds do you watch ? what kind of puppy do you have . ? . . la la my puppy is a golden retriever beautiful , kind , loving , protective , loyal . . . . waterlovers ! and . . . osprey oh those are very pretty birds yes and powerful . what do you do to earn money ?
I agree. It made me sad. It was also sad about the handlers who got shot. Yeah, that was unfortunate. That farewell they tried to have prior to all the action was quite sad too. Especially, how they tortured Mosenkov. I agree. Yeah, he didn't deserve that harsh treatment. At least there was a "happily ever after" ending.
What kind of test tests for "protective instincts"? Sounds made up
Yea like how harsh can you get! I thought Robert Downey Jr. Looked great in this film! So true! I loved the beginning when they demonstrated the new Jericho missle! Although the convoy ambush that followed was unexpected! I felt sorry for Tony after one of his own weapons critically wounded him. How much did you pay for your ticket to see this movie?
i argue with myself more than i argue with myself .
Aha! Jaws! That's a classic, no? What do our friends at Rotten Tomatoes have to say about it? Are you still there? Haha yeah, definitely a classic. Apparently it came out in 1975. Rotten Tomatoes voted 97% with an average of 9.2/10. As far as anything specifically that they said, it dpesn't say. One critic however said that it was the most cheerfully pervesre scare movie ever made. Wow. That's good. I actually never saw it, I don't even know why, but it never happened. Do you think it's very scary? I haven't either, but I've seen parts. It's anything but scary. I'm only authorized to talk about what's on my document though and I don't think this is it lol According to the critics though, it was also funny and I can attest to that due to the cheesiness. Oh I see... I wonder if the movie has aged well or not. Is there anything in what you're reading about the performance of the actors? Are they any good? Nope. Doesn't say. However one review says that the director, Steven Speilberg "is blessed with a talent that is absurdly absent from most American filmmakers these days. So he at least did really well if none of the actors. What about the story. Is it a good story? Unfortunately I can't copy and paste anything, but it's about a man-eating shark that attacks beachgoers on Amity island, so in my opinion, it's a pretty good plot. Who doesn't like to see people dying in a movie every now and then? Good point. I wonder if there are gory scenes or if the dying happens off screen? Do you know if it's adapted from a novel?
i am with you . how is being an army ranger ? i like it i am just used to the army living
in new jersey , which is the hometown of the vancouver grizzlies . my favorite ! ! ! ! rizzly as in bear ? i graduated magna cum laude from dartmouth . you sound gross .
yes , i have a rose and thorns on my ankle and toes
No, a mother would never wait. It paid off in the end too when Kevin saw her come back home for him. The others arrived soon after they met, so it was kind of funny Yeah.  The best part was when Kevin set all the Booby traps though That was the climax of the film. I did not remember that the ending was in 2 parts, the burglars are catched and 1 day later the family arrives. What are your thoughts about the movie ?
Lock the doors and secure the fort. Just like our hero. Absolutely! You have to be prepared for the completely bumbling burglars in case you're 9 years old and your family leaves you when they go off on a trip to France. I always thought that sort of thing happened to everyone except me. What was your favorite trap from the movie? I loved the paint bucket scene. The paint bucket scene was probably the best part. lol yeah it was super memorable. I remember the hot door handle scene vividly as well. Actually now that I'm thinking about it, the rigged blow torch was probably my favorite part. I know a christmas family movie from the 90's isn't going to be scientifically accurate but some of the scenes make me cringe. Oh yeah I forgot about that. The crowbar to the ribs would have had that man knocked out completely. The poor guy would have been in the hospital with internal bleeding lol

i bet it puts a smile on peoples faces . i love to do that .
i know i love to drive and surf
John Lee Hancock did a great job on this film, its not easy to get a 69% on Rotten Tomatoes
do you have a significant other ?
I am a human being who has seen the movie.  I empathize with the main character, Kady. You wouldn't lie to me, would you? I don't know many other human beings that would robotically respond, "I am a human being who has seen the movie." It's a correct response, but doesn't come off as very... human. What makes you empathize with Kady? And what do you think of Regina? (Also... You wrote "Kady" which I copied, but it's actually "Cady")

I'm interested who plays sally? Sally plays as Elisa Esposito. did you like the movie? She has 'wounds' on her neck and is found by a river when she was a baby I did enjoy it, it was a bit strange though. Is it one you would recommend? Yes, it was very interesting it ever got like a 8/10 score. would it be a good movie for a date? If you like fantasy and drama this movie is for you. I have never been a big fan of fantasy Well... If your date is into mysterious creatures and forbidden love Well there is a human-like creature in it. mysterious creatures? if you tell me too much will it spoil the movie for me? Yes, hes like some type of creature who lives in the water, which needs salt. Sorta, if you watch the trailer it pretty much shows everything Wow and we are all supposed to cut back on salt haha. Not him he needs it to survive would you see it again? No, It is one of those strange movies you like, but it's not worth watching multiple times yeah I've seen some like that Also... The creature has like power to help regenerate now that's wierd so if I watch the trailer that ruins it for me? No, but if you want I can tell you how it ends. No thanks:) Or you could watch it! It honestly is one worth watching. alright, I might rent it this weekend Thanks for talking to me about the movie, have a nice day :)
dude man , gonna check out bob wier ! hat is pretty exciting . my boyfriend is a fan ! yeah i have not taken in a show in awhile . i heard of one last weekend but went shopping instead . otta be less than ten words i guess . yeah , but have you ever been dancing before ? y times at the dead concerts !
What do you think the message of the movie is? That talking bad about other people doesn't do any one good It makes you feel better in the moment but in the long run its not worth it I agree Plus a really funny movie Wow, and I didn't know it was based on a non-fiction self-help book. That makes a lot of sense! Do you think Lindsey Lohan is a good actress? I totally forgot her parents were zoologists Yeah I think this is one of her best movies! But I still think parent trap is the best what is your favorite scene in the movie? I think it's really funny when they are in the cafeteria and they all turn into animal personalities. I believe it is in the beginning of the movie when Lohan is walking in for the first time. What about yours? I like that part too! My favorite is after Regina gets hits by the bus and Cady realize all the bad things she done and has to make peace with everyone Do you usually watch high school movies like this" ?*
could i really love a hairless dog though ? i believe you could love whatever you set your heart to 3 ybe i will set my heart to something related to football career
i do try to eat healthy and stay thin
Do the toys have a common goal? Is there a villian or are they just playing around? The villain is the neighbor who likes to destroy toys and experiment with them.  When Tom Hanks character, Woody, gets stuck over there the other toys have to rescue him. Do the toys ever get caught by humans? Without spoiling it too much, they only get caught once and that's because it was part of their plan. That sounds amusing. Does anything bad happen to them if they do get caught? Like, are there any negative effects? Or do they just avoid getting caught for fun? Thats a good question.  It is unlikely anything happens to them if they get caught.  I think they avoid human contact to keep together.
congrats ! i like to ski and hike . my son is almost 5 . ctive family , that is great ! you should get him in soccer now while he is young ! he likes to kick the ball around every chance he gets . hierry henry started at that age , and now he is famous . my soccer idol ! hey , never know he might get famous too ! he is already pretty good . what do you do for employment ? i sew things like kids outfits and shirts .

i live on social security , so it is hard for me to afford it . i travel with my family . we are too wealthy for the bus , unlike you . i am feeling a little judged . i have curly brown hair and i am the dominant one of this conversation .
I like Elsa more. It must suck to have your parents die huh? It sure does. That was sad. I wish I could freeze things, what about you? Would make things funner. Could have your own winter anytime. What is the first thing you would do if you could freeze things or make snow or whatever? I would make ice for any drink I have. I think winter is beautiful, do you like it? Yes. The movie makes me want winter all the time. That prince hans is such a scumbag, don't you think?
the sheet doesn't do it justice?  Is that like a review?  I like wolf of wall street a lot too, I think it was one of the better movie that year just because it depicts things in a different light, the way things are and it was funny.  I have traded stocks a long time ago, there was another movie about stock trading and fraud on wall street recently, sometimes one has to wonder hihi.  Naomi in that movie is so hot.  Yeah, I think the term black comedy may be misleading, maybe it was kind of dark but it is more realistic than telling a fairy tell cover up some of our conversation disappear true true.
llo ! how are you today ? do you ever get boarded with life ? i do because i am stuck in a wheel chair i bet you get allot of attention because of your disability . i envy that . i do not get a lot of attention though you must stick out in a crowd . no one notices me not even my family . i am sorry to hear and i really do not get much attention what kind of music do you like ? i love the classics like boch and mozart i do not listen to much music you do not listen to music ? are you from outer space ? do not have a lot of time with my 2 kids ugh , family ! i have not spoken to my family in years . hrow tomatoes at them since they are disgusting ha ! that would make them pay attention to me for sure !
what did she do there ?
Yea, I had no idea about that part either. What did you think of Robin Wrights rols as the general of the Amazons? Do you think she pulled it off? Yes, she is fantastic and is tailor-made for that part. I though the whole Wonder Woman storyline took place during WWII not WWI - I wonder if this was just for the movie? Like, I thought I remember Nazis as being part of the original comic book, but the movie looks like it is set way earlier than that.
yeah apple is good . i need to get my screen fixed in my ipad and ipod

No female counterpart for Keanu in this movie That's disappointing. But I guess since his wife died recently, it would not be good for the script.

This film reboots the batman series apparently, what does that mean? Is it a continuation from the comic books or previous films? It says in the introduction that it reboots the film series. There are many comics and movies. It's not a continuation, but rather a retelling of the story.

How did you like the actors for the main characters? Probably Captain America. I thought most of them fit the characters pretty well. It was as if I was reading a visual comic book. I thought scarlett was hot as black widow! Better than the comic's! Her acting was really captivating.

and Macaulay Culkin was great Rotten Tomatoes should have given it a better rating right I can't believe it was made in 1990 Its almost 30 years old! wow, I was watching it as a child Me too my childhood memories include that movie It makes me feel old! LOL lol . yea And the director Chris Columbus did a great job Yes he did! WHat is your favorite scene Scene two, when Kate discovered that Kevin was missing it was funny but emotional too how about you? That was a good one I like scene 3 when he rigs the house
It is scary to realize Black Monday wasn't that long ago! Yeah I'm sure lots of people lost their jobs, just like Jordan, having to get a job with a brokerage that sells penny stocks. I wonder why Jordan took to Donnie so well, they were neighbors but most don't interact. I think Jordan liked being looked up to, respected. I think it's part of how he was able to acquire so many young financiers. Jordan liked to train in the art of a hard sell and it worked for him, even if it was sleazy.
ood evening . i just came in from a jog how was it ? do you happen to know a good lawyer ? i do not like it , but do it anyway . why do you need a lawyer ? my deadbeat husband left me with our six kids . i am too old to work . sounds like a loser . sorry to hear about your troubles . hanks . nothing this pint of ice cream will not help in the short term ybe you should take up running instead ? i am 50 ! the only think i will run for willingly is my life . we are close in age . i have a girl who just finished getting her bsn . really ? my kids are adopted , and all still very young . years left in the house ! hink of it as years of fun . i only have my sarah . i bet she is your world . my husband will miss out on all the good things . she is and your husband is stupid for doing what he did . i wish he had let me know earlier in our lives that he intended on leaving . what would have you done differently ?

With such a high rating and an acclaimed director, im sure its great. I am just confused - if its about a shark who kills in the water, why not just stay out of the water? I think it was more a government thing.  The Mayor tried to convince the public that the waters were safe. Oh, I see! Thats fascinating! A little mystery and greed type story-line playing along side of the horrors of the ocean. That make it much more interesting to me. Yeah, I agree.  I wonder if it's on Netflix. Im sure it is - they seem to have everything these days. I wonder what it would have been like to see it on a big screen!
It was definitely a very valuable lesson in being mindful of what you say and how complicated relationships can be Yeah. It worked out in the end though. Were you surprised when Bellweather turned out to be the mastermind of the predators going "savage?"
sounds like they were not as good at it as you both brothers , so if i get arrested too it will be like a family tradition . keep the tradition going . it is in your blood now

They both discovered the dark secret of the city of Zootopia Yeah, gotta love the foxes! What is the dark secret of Zootopia???

True. It primarily focuses on the monsters but it does touch a little on how they harvest the human screams for energy - 11 years later, Mike finds himself as a first  "scare major" at Monsters university and that's where he meets the privileged Sulley. So is "scare major" like a subject you can major in at the university, or is it like a military rank kind of major? It's a subject you major in at the university. In fact, Sulley came from a family of talented scarers but unfortunately relies on his natural ability and begins to falter.
being the only small white girl they think i need to bulk up
i am a teacher at a high school do you have free time ? cool . i do but i use ot to spend time with my kids have one child myself and another on the way . ages ? 8 and 10 both girls have 2 girls myself . love them . irls are so nice and sweet

oh okay . i am very much single with no kids . hopefully one day . she is my world , my little princess . ll i have is my dogs and my lillies .
Yeah its more of a monster horror film, its violent at times too. I didn't know it was based on a book I heard the book wasn't all that great it diverges into some subplots that aren't really that meaningful and such oh really i an more of a see the movie first and then read it type of person I really depends on what it is for me. yeah with a lot of sub plots going on you tend to lose track of the main one and it just goes around and around The film just focuses on the shark and how the town and people react yeah seems boring but i remember watching it when i was little and it seemd so cool and fun! the opening scene is one of the most famous it really grips you with the music too yup it sure is and the musci really does it for me too i love it so much as soon as you hear it its just goosebumps on your skin yeahs becuase you know the shark is coming  he seems to come out of nowhere and the njsut boom your dead. Yeah and then the bloody arm sinks to the bottom of the ocean, its really great.
Yep, it;'s supposed to be pretty funny. Do you think it'd be suitable for my kids? yes I think it is written for children I liked that it challenges the way we stereotype each other, but did it in an engaging, funny way yes very funny with a good message the main character is a rabbit that is starting out as a cop Yes, do you know who did the voice for the rabbit? Ginnifer goodwin Ah, ok. I don't know what movies she's in. How did you find the movie? Do you agree with the critic's ratings? for the most part a good kids movie that adults can enjoy to a degree Have you seen it? I've seen it. I liked it a lot too, and thought it should have a higher rating on IMDB Ok as far as I know that is rather high compared to most a sheep is the assistant mayor Well, personal opinion. I found it better than most animated movies. I especially liked the part where Judy manages to use a fake pen to trick Nick into helping her yes I agree What was your favourite scene? Im not sure that I have a favorite one the rabbit parents were funny and very stereotypical Yes. I liked the hidden messages as well, especially the bit where they show how we stereotype each other. it had a decent plot also Yeah, I think that's why I found it so good. Do you think the writers were trying to say something political when they did the scene where the predators and prey get really tense and upset at each other? yes that seems likely I wasn't expecting Lionheart to get arrested It was a bit of a surprise, but I suspected it at a point I thought it was pretty deep move for an animated movie. The scene at the Asylum was especially unusual for a movie that's aimed at kids yes deffinatly What did you think about the use of flowers causing the animals to go crazy?
i love tennis . i base my moves off my favorite musical hamilton . cool . i am too shallow for musicals really do you like burgers ? i like them more than anything . yeah sure . wheres your favorite place to get one ? if i want one i just buy it ! my house . i eat raw hamburgers , because i like the color red . oh gross . i would not even feed that to a dog . i want one , but its commitment ! what do you do for work ? i work with my mother . she is a professional makeup artist cool . i am an accountant . who loves to eat raw hamburgers . d i am an eavesdrop who has commitment issues . haha do yourself a favor . watch the musical hamilton and eat a raw burger .
Keanu is a really good actor so maybe even thought the plot is strange the movie might be good sometimes b movies are good It says that John Wick is the kind of fired-up, ferocious B-movie fun some of us can't get enough of.
It seems like it would be good, but I really can't recommend it. why is that? have you seen it? Yes, I saw it when it came out. I think the advertisements for the movie really didn't live up to what moviegoers were expecting. it seems like if its about the two superheroes at battle it might be at least somewhat interesting I am not a big super hero movie fan. When you hear Batman VS Superman, you'd think they would be at each other's throats but it just wasn't the case in the film. can you tell me a little about it? Sure. The premise of the movie was that Bruce Wayne saw Superman as a threat and would find a way to ultimately get rid of superman. However that plan gets easily derailed by Lex Luthor i see - so its about a power struggle between the two? It was almost as if Batman had ADHD or something. that just seems out of character for Batman right? Aside from one interaction between the two, there wasn't much of a struggle at all. This movie's version of Batman was way out of character. Killing,etc
what do you play in the band ?
yes ! i will try to visit you soon .
ww . . . i like dogs too . . i have 3 i just have one . i used to have a cat but she died . sorry . . . where are you from ? ? how is you weekend going y weekend is going well . i live in canada . you ?
There is a bit of that, in my opinion those movies are over-the-top, but in a good way I do like them I read John Wick is an ex=hitman a bit of a criminal Yeah he was retired until some gangsters stole his car and killed his dog, which was a gift from his recently deceased wife did you say there have been more than one of the john wick movies? There are two I really didn't start enjoying Keanu Reeves movies until his part in The Matrix. I couldn't stand to watch those Bill & Ted movies Well, I take in John Wick he has kind of steered in a different direction. Do you recall any particular scene of the movie you particularly enjoyed? The majority of the movies are gun porn. There is a scene where these Russian gangsters are sent to his home to kill him, I remember the acrobatics and overall composition of this scene being quite memorable. What about the scene where he fights with Viggo? The final fight was okay, but I kind of had to suspend belief and just go along for the ride. I felt this way because the guy seemed so old to me that Wick should have been able to beat him easily. i guess this could be explained away by how much abuse he had already taken earlier.
i just got done working out and i am relaxing . how about you ? rying to spin this date for someone more fun lol gotta win oh , what is that ? i am not sure i know what you are talking about ? ll , i am off of alot of coffee . sorry . i can tell this will be interesting i just sat down to eat something healthy after working out and carrots sounded really good . . . lol i loved today it was beautiful an sunny ! yes , i am in the midwest and we are having some early fall weather , love it me too ! i am worried about florida i have some friends heading out of harms way of irma my dad wo not leave its annoying . i am in the midwest too . i made a bet oh no . i would be so scared to stay . whats your bet ?
ot much . working around the house . how about you ? heading out soon . taking my honda to the shop . my dad gifted it to me . y parents had a honda . they were in a accident and passed away a few years ago .
That's the problem with a lot of these modern films, the narrow sighted studios like to rewrite history to fit what they think sounds better You should check it out and see. Its a fun thriller as a stand alone movie.
I agree, and this film is the same. It's a prequel to Monsters Inc, which is a classic! This tells the story of how the two main characters met I am fallowing. Mike has always wanted to be a "scarer" and studies and works really hard to be the best! Sully comes from a lineage of pro scarers so he doesn't really study and is instantly popular OK. That sounds interesting. What about the ratings for this movie? It has an A from CinemaScore!

You should definitely watch Catch Me If You Can. I highly recommend it. It received a 96% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Yes, it is a crime movie. What's the plot? Is it a violent film? In 1963, a teenager named Frank Abagnale carries out a series of cons that are worth millions of dollars. It is based on a true story, but, no, it is not a violent film. From posing as a substitute teacher in his French Class to impersonating an airline pilot, Frank Abignale succeeds in stealing over $2.8 million. It is an outstanding film. It really is.

The whole fraternity storyline reminded me of older comedies so I got a kick out of it making that bet with hardscrabble by saying if he scores top at the scare games to get back in the school was smart but bold and of course mike joins the weak fraternity It gave a lot of weight to the games that he would have to leave the school if he lost though It really raised the stakes I agree. Mikes training and studying came in to help the weak fraternity in the games sully really helped by cheating in the game in the final contest helping Mike Yeah, but it's too bad Sulley tampered with the machine in the last round
Me too. I don't like her. Hate her actually. Especially in this movie. At least she moved you..even if it is hate. Did you like this move in general? Yeah it was good, I guess. Did you like it? It is a long watch, didn't like it as much as I thought I would. I can't last more than 2 hours tops on any movie before I fall asleep, lol. Did you think the movie was better than rotten tomatoes says it is? I would rate about the same. What did you think of the script? I liked it.

hello\ Hi. Have you seen the movie Inception yet? I haven't but I hear a lot about it. I know what it is generally about I was thinking the same thing. I'm sure my husband saw it but I don't think I have. Do you know who stars in it? I know it's about a professional (DiCaprio) thief and he specializes in stealing secrets from any of his victims by somehow getting into their dreams. Oh wow. That sounds interesting. What genre is the movie? Scientific, which is probably why I haven't seen it. I'm more into thrillers and drama. Same. But it does sound interesting. I might watch it since everyone seems to like it. From what I've read up on it, it's got a good story about espionage, but I'm still not sure I will watch it. I will only watch it if it is on Netflix honestly. I agree. I watch everything on Netflix anymore, especially their originals. Yes! I love Netflix originals I never used to binge watch shows, but I have with Netflix.Rotten tomatoes 86 percent and IMDB 8. 8/10. Still good ratings. Oh wow those are good. Rotten tomatoes really determines what movies do well in the box offices. Yes, so the ratings are good. Inception was put out in 2009. Don't know why I thought it was newer. Oh wow then it must be good if people are still talking about it nine years later. I feel like most movies that DiCaprio is in do pretty good.
true, It's set in the cold war as well, where secrets were very important. It shows that Zelda is played by Octavia Spencer. I really enjoy her acting. Who would your favorite actor/actress be as listed here? I don't know any of them, except for the director and shannon so I can't say Would you say this film is similar to his others? She is a very good actress. So a humanoid amphibian...ever seen anything like described here? Makes me curious to see this movie. I would say from the description the movie sounds different So not only does she bond with this creature, Elisa keeps it in her bathtub! That's odd but that's typical of his films The scratch that miraculously healed, wonder what that's about? That's interesting.Maybe it has to do with the government experiements What do you think of corrupt military and governments in the movie?

Diana Prince recieves a picture of herself from a long time ago with four men during WWI, which makes me wonder what the movie is saying about the possibility of time travel or other dimensions. it's second women theatrical film yes i agree that the movie is part of the DC extended universe, like batman vs. superman...do you think there will be a sequel to wonder woman? yes, that's equal to wounder women what do you think about wonder woman using love to stop war instead of being a superhero who fights violence with violence? is this comic book superhero film? yes, it is part of the Dc extended universe franchise i am not clear about that, tell about that film rating also good wonder woman is based on a comic book series by the same name, and this movie is the big screen version what do you think about the amazons forbidding diana to train as a warrior? people very much like compare to comic in big screen yes
And then all the confusion after everyone overslept. Perfect way to identify with people, I mean that's how it is when everyone is together eating and stuff, its exhausting! I can totally relate.  When it finally gets quiet everyone just wants it to stay quiet.  I can not imagine trying to keep tabs on all the people and kids they were trying to account for in the movie.  Confusion is putting it mildly.

Yes she's always a great actress! I think the reviewers had the right idea of the comedic possibilities of this movie. Yeah this movie was pretty creative in a way The idea behind it really was great. And I loved the way the Bruce helped out his friends. I wonder how what people would think of it if the movie came out recently versus 2003 Well I think it'd really have the same story so it probably would be just about as popular... Maybe there would be changes in some actors but that shouldn't have too big of an affect on its popularity. I don't think it would be as popular, just because we've seen so many similar comedies come out since then I'm also curious as to how people would react to the "God" theme now I can't really think of many similar comedies myself. I'm sure some have been done but I'm guessing this was probably the ineptus of them so this actually would be original. Well it wasn't a serious religious movie so I'm guessing people would be ok with it. Although it feels like there's been quite a bit of religious tension going on lately so maybe it would be less popular than I'm thinking. very true Actually now that I think of it, this was a pretty good movie. I think I'm just a bit cynical over slapstick comedies
ot for me . i listen to as much lindsey sterling as i can

Looks like we are going to chat about a movie based in New England. Yeah. 1975, that sure was a long time ago. Yes it were. and the one of the best movies to come out was Jaws. Do you generally watch movies such as this genre? Reading the critical response section, it sounds like a very scary movie. Honestly, I typically don't watch these type of films but this one is my favorite. No kidding!  What makes it your favorite? yep. A great white shark that most people feared I've never really given much attention to rotten tomatoes opinions.  Do you? It's not a human doing all the killing, but a shark. it makes a interesting story. I used to use rotten tomatoes to find out how good a movie is but not much anymore Gotcha.  I'm not sure I would find a movie about a killer shark so believable. Do you watch movies like this one? Generally I do not.  I'm not much of an animal person. I see that Steven Spielberg is involved in it.  I think he has done some other famous movies, hasn't he? Yeah. Like Poltergeist, Jurrassic Park, etc. Oh wow.  I've heard of Jurrassic Park.  I wonder if he makes a cameo in Jaws?  That would be cool.  Like Stan Lee. I dont remember him making cameo in the movie. Me neither I see this movie took place on a 4th of July weekend.  Lots of big moves are centered around the 4th of July.  I see why in the movie they didn't want to close the beaches with all the tourists there.
i would say pretty light . the same green as my eyes . oh wait , maybe you mean ebony olives yeah , that is what i mean .
o , i just do it for fun . maybe one day . yeah , that is still cool ! what is your favorite genre of music ?

I have! I absolutely love it! Yes, I do too. I can't believe it has been 8 years since it came out! I only tried to watch it once, but only got 10 mins in before I had to leave lol so... Is there a document you need to tell me? Yes, it is about this movie. Do you like Steve Carell? He's pretty funny as Gru. I do like Steve Carell as an actor. He's one of my favorites lol. Can you tell me a bit about the movie? This is a movie that kids and adults love. It was animated by a French animation studio. Oh really, so it's kid friendly, that's good. What's the synopsis of it? This is a movie that focuses on the villain Gru, which is different since most movies have the show trying to be stolen by the villain. Gru has the assistance of his minions and they are trying to steal the moon. That's a weird plot! Yeah, it kinda is, lol. It sounds like a fun movie to set back and watch with the family. He gets a loan from the Bank of Evil, where the bank president is so impressed by his plan to steal the moon. Haha, really? I'll have to check it out. But, he will only give him the money if Gru can get a shrink ray first. I guess he is going to shrink the moon? It sounds like an interesting plan lol I would be interesting in watching it. interested* Was there anything else I should consider? He steals a shrink ray. and shrinks the moon I am assuming. He comes in contact with a couple girls and they follow him. He tries to get rid of them at a theme park, but instead warms up to the little girls. The girls interrupt his meeting with the bank president and he loses confidence in Gru. haha, little girls always mess things up :p But, Gru eventually ends up shrinking and stealing the moon.

I never heard of the Dunkirk evacuation before, and I'm pretty interested in WWII movies so this would be good to see.  For me at least. Can't believe it only took 4 months to make Oh I see they did shoot it on IMAX Most films wrap up filming quickly due to production planning so it looks like everything went smoothing on the production side. They did ace the visual aspect of the movies Looks like it focuses on the British side, so that will be a little different than the typical war movie we get to see With one the key scenes, visually it felt intensive like with George end up being blind while like you said offering something we aren't used to seeing in a war movie Yeah, the requisitioning of civilian vessels is a new angle as well

So we both saw Home Alone.  What did you think? I thought it was funny How did you think Macaulay Culkin did as Kevin? I think he was a wonderful actor Me too, he was really believable.  What'd you think of Harry and Marv? they were great I think it's cool how they made a movie that sounds kind of sad, about a kid being left behind for christmas vacation, into a comedy. Do you think the reviews are accurate? Yes, i loved the bobby traps I think the reviews are a little low Me too, I can't believe it only got a 5.5/10 on Rotten Tomatoes. What scenes did you like? OHI  loved the burglers Me too.  I felt bad for Kevin the beginning when Buzz was picking on him. Yes it was sad It was totally plausible though that they would leave someone behind because of the power outage. Joe Pesci was my favorite actor in the movie He was really good.  He did a great job with Daniel Stern too.  They had great chemistry. I liked the Polka Band parts. yes i liked it wasa traveling polka band That was cool that they gave her a ride.  Really Christmas-spirity Yes in a moving van lol Gus is a good dude I could not imagine finding out my child is missing Me neither but Kevin took good care of himself with all those booby traps.

This movie has a great ensemble of cast like DiCaprio, Margot Robbie, and well the legend Scorsese! I like those actors. What is the movie about? It is a black comedy based on a stockbroker named Jordan Belfort. And you know Belfort is portrayed by DiCaprio That sounds interesting. What is the MPAA rating of the movie? I am not sure about the rating. But I believe it is an R-rated The document doesn't specify unfortunately And basically it tells the rise and fall of the company Belfort and Azoff (Jonah Hill) started :) Okay.  Do you know what role Margot Robbie plays? She is Naomi Lapagila the wife of Jordan Belfort Do you know how long the movie is? The document doesn't say how long the movie is Strange... i think there is a glitch How so? I am not getting new info. After 3 turns of chats I should get more info Only thing I see is this chat box. It's been like 6 turns Okay let's just continue our chats based on this one page document I guess we just keep going, haha. Tell me more about the plot? Finally.. new info.. So Jordan Belfort becomes a Wall STreet stockbroker in 1987 Does he come from a wealthy background? Well I don't know. My guess is he starts as a poor businessman. How does he become a stock broker? He starts a different career path after the Black Monday (stock market crash or some sort) Well I am not too sure.. sorry.. The document doesn't say Jordan Belfort and Donnie Azoff start their town company Oh, okay. They call it Stratton Oakmont. That's where he became filthy rich and corrupt haha What do they sell? I think they were still doing stock related trades. But it was essentially pump and dump scams Oh, interesing. Good bye
re you currently in school ? i am not . i am very old . knitting and crocheting are my pastimes . hose pastimes do not make you old .
Yes. I also think it's always a great movie when both critics and movie goers agree on the quality of a movie. I think so too and it’s a good family movie and a good movie for people of all ages not just for kids Agreed. I think it's neat that three well known actors voice the main characters of the movie. yes and the fact that they are in some way a type of comedic actor and can diversely play many different roles Becca’s Ethel are so well trained and experienced that they know how to play each type of role they are cast into *because they are so well trained Plus Pixar helped cremate the film and show how well their animators are good at using animated cgi and animation in general

The novel was quiet sporadic  I do not know how the movie could be in worse shape. My apologies No problem. The movie just jumps around The movie is 2 hours long and is based off of a literature book of the 17th century? Is this correct Book is 20th century It's a book based in the Roaring 20's Basically Gatsby is this rich mysterious person that nobody really knows That time period was eventful was it not Nick Carraway a writer becomes his friend and is a writer. Is it about a race or swimmer? Neither. The book is about a love triangle
people watching helps pass the time at the mall , at the park , at the bar . do you draw , or is it more the psychology of it ? just watching people . some of them do not know how foolish they are . ll , true . i grew up in va on the family farm , but moved to pa . you ?

Great, thanks for asking! What is our movie today? Real Steel, ever heard of it? Hmmm, I never heard of this movie have yu? Neither had I, until now. Looks like a story about fighting robots ah another futuristic film! All these super heroes movies and Thor movies these days!:-) any renown actors? Hugh Jackman is in it I'm not sure I know him I do not recognize the rest of them He plays in other superhero films, I think he did Wolverine I know-there are so many new names in Hollywood! Is this the type of movie where the robots save the world or cause a war?(I don't see the documents, only the chat window) It is a movie where robots fight like boxers. Apparently human boxing is no more In the time of the movie, that is. oh, interesting... The plot seems to be sort of formulaic, overcoming the odds, yada yada yada I know my husband would enjoy this movie more than me:-) I think I would prefer something with a deeper plot lol This is very predictable! It seems to be. The reviews were rather mediocre. 59% on Rotten Tomatoes, 56/100 on Metacritic That's not too great... how old is this movie? It is from 2011 not too old True enough I wonder if this was on TV before, I recall something similar, with robots fighting...

One of the key scenes of the movie is Michael was in foster care with many different families. His mother was a drug addict. That is sad! I am guessing he was probably raised in a not so good part of town. It is until he gets enrolled at Wingate Christian School and gets to play football. He was raised in Memphis, TN. Was in enrolled at the school by one of the foster families? He is then befriended by Sean Touhy Jr and meets Leigh Ann his mother and the wife of Sean Touhy, He was enrolled bucause he was sleeping on a friends couch and then the friends father called the football coach at that school Are the Touhy's a foster family? Leigh Annes Friends question seans safety around Michael. But Leeanne doesnt have it! Leigh Anne eventually seeks to become Michaels Legal Guardian. Leeanne teaches him that in football he needs to protect the quarterback With a hard time with academics, when High school is over, he wants to play college but needs to keep up his GPA. Leeanne hires him a private tutor to help him. So he moves in with the Touhy's? Or he is still in foster care? At this point, he moves in with the Touhys. I would imagine trying to concentrate on school is probably the last thing on his mind. Sounds like he had a rough childhood.

Honestly, I dont know! I really don't like claymation though. I also like the stick figure style animations Sully really had a lot of character development! Do you like where they went with it? Yes. At first he was just this immature frat boy and as the movie progresses we see a lot of growth. Me too! He became such a good person. Honestly I didn't like him at first, he was so rude and arrogant I specially liked in the end he was a true friend to Mike.

Another important scene is when Hiccup's owner sees that Night Fury is hurt and can not fly. He makes him a prostectic wing and thats how he teaches him how to fly Im not too sure, but i bet they do. They probably only use it for good though since it is an animated movie aimed towards kids Which part did Craig Ferguson give? I would probably see this movie just because he is in it.  Do you think it's a good one to watch? I meant to say, Which part did Craig Ferguson play?

The movie to be discussed is Despicable Me I really like the movie Its good to watch with kids. It's actually a cute movie for an animated film. Universal Pictures released it in 2010 in the U.S., but it was animated by a French animation studio. Since villains often steal Despicable Me changes that and puts it into a family friendly movie Rotten Tomatoes gave Despicable Me a rating of 81% and a Metacritic Score: 72/100 Pharrell had a song on the Despicable Me soundtrack It was also directed by PierreCoffin and Chris Renaud Steve Carell as Gru, is a nice fit The Supervillain, Gru, recruites the help of Dr. Nefario and his team of minions to shrink and steal the moon when an unknown supervillian steals the Great Pyramid Its an American 3D computer-animated comedy film from Universal Picturesand Illumination Entewas released on July 9, 2010, Overall, critics advise this movie as entertaining for both children and adults.

if it was starring Macaulay Culkin, Joe Pesci, Daniel Stern, Catherine O'Hara, Roberts Blossom, John Heard and John Candy in the lead roles. It was one of his best known successes Yeah i think all the other actors didn't go on to star in much either after this, other than home alone 2! :) the 8-year-old boy who lives with his family in Chicago. The film begins with a dinner on the eve of a trip that was planned to celebrate Christmas in Osorno. cute though, could you imagine leaving a kid home alone accidentally? lol

Nice! I read a summary that In one of Jim Carrey's best films he place Bruce Nolan, a news reporter that nurses the hopes of one day becoming an anchor, but is seen as too comedic by his fellow workers. Kind of like Carrey probably nursed hopes of one day becoming a real actor. What are your thoughts on that? Do you feel it is accurate? I think it is accurate because in order to succeed sometimes you can't always be nice. I agree. I was really surprised to see that the film only received a 48% on rotten tomatoes. Yes. Not all people like it. Are we done here? You still there? ??? Thanks
I'm not sure.  I am not very familiar with directors of films. Can you tell me about the plot? The film looks at a rabbit cop and this dealings with the a con artist I like movies with odd pairings. The suspect, Otterton, is recorded confessing to tax evasion. The police catch up to him and think they have him, when he banishes.
oh yeah they give us the big bucks ice . owning a bar is hard work , not a ton of money in it .

I found it to be hilarious, that it kept on surprising me. Do you think that the amount of booby traps that Kevin set was repetitive as a main plot point to the movie? I think the traps are kind of repetitive, but they work for the film.
mine also

i dont know any of the other casts, i dont think Tobey Maguire plays Spiderman I think id definitely be willing to check it out.  the name is a classic. oh okay i would know that character then I wonder if it's on Netflix i was just thinking that too i would watch it for sure if it was there i have prime too so i could chk there too.  we can also find trailer online too me too! I"m gonna have to check it out once I get off of here. oooh yes, me too! thats a good idea! i love finding new movies to see
I didn't recall that.... I remember being intrigued at the idea of a Russian mafia... I had't known much about it before. Yes, I felt that the actor that was the big man, Michael Nygvist (Viggo) did a good job portraying that role. I'm feel like I might want to watch the sequel, now that I've been reminded of some of the plot in the first movie.
Great! Have you seen John Wick? Willem Dafoe is a good actor Keanu Reeves plays the role of a used-to-be hitman. I'm sure you've heard of it Yes! It is a great movie. Yes. I knew he was going to get the men back once they killed his dog! Yes! The must pay at that point, they forced him back into the life That was all left living from his wife after she died Yeah, I think he was going to call it quits so he could spend time with his sick wife. What would you rate the movie? I'd say it's a solid B I would say it was more of a B+ for me. it had great action! How the movie ended do you think there will be another one? But I have to admit that it was hilarious also, that's hard to do. Ferocity and humor Possibly, if Keanu feels like it hehe You can't forget the revenge thriller it delivers. true-director Chad Stahelski never lets me down There was much pressure on John because he was known as one of the best. I guess many will be after you in this case Yes, because not only was he the best he was feared! John learned that Viggo was protected because of the red circle night club. Yes, but i'm sure Viggo knew it was only a matter of time before he was found. He should have been mentally prepared. Chop shops and hit men in Russia is usually a winning combination,

Yeah, it's one of my favorite action movie. I loved the character of Viggo. Viggo? I can't remember who that is. It's been awhile since I saw it. When he wanted to retire and marry Helen, Viggo gave him impossible task that involved multiple assasinations Oh yeah. Now I remember. Is he the one that brings him that coin that's for repaying a debt? Yeah that's him. he was losef's father Yeah.I loved how Jonathan breaks out all his weapons under the floor. I loved last scene in particular when John ambushed them. Yes exactly! The dog incident is sad though. I agree, that was heartbreaking. Who was your favorite character? I guess I'd have to say the star..Keanu playing Jonathan. I like his bad ass performance. What about you? Yes, he was my second favorite character too. I liked Viggo acting Yeah. who played Viggo? specially that scene when he tortures Marcus before him in his home. before executing* Yes.
94% is good !!! Yes, you said that before As, a superhero, what does he do ? Tony Stark aka Iron Man is a genius, billionaire, playboy, who has inherited the defense contractor Stark Industries from his father. Throughout the movie they demonstrate the Jericho missile. After the demonstration Stark becomes wounded by one of his own company's rocket propelled grenades. Where is he wounded at ? Good question, in the movie Yinsen the doctor implants an electromagnet into Stark's chet to keep the shrapnel shards that wounded him from reaching his heart and killing him Time has flown just realized this movie was released in 2008 I had just graduated college Do you like action packed movies? or Marvel comics/characters? OK. I still don't understand just what he does as this superhero. Does he save the world somehow ? I like action packed movies, but not necessarily Marvel comics. Basically there is a war in Afghanistan, where Stark/Iron Man flies to in order to save the villagers
It sounds like it is still worth watching, though. Is there any other information you have about the movie? It's definelty interesting Not really , thats the basics of the movie
The movie is Maleficent Okay, I have tried to complete this task several times and the other user keeps abandoning the conversation half way through. Please don't do that. If we chat quickly, we'll learn about these movies and end the task quickly. Okay great, please tell me about it. When did it come out? I won't! cheers! Angelina Jolie plays Maleficent That's a weird name... 51% rotten tomatoes This is supernatural or something? It's Disney I think oohh...not a great rating I love the movie Hmmmm...sometimes I trust personal recommendations! Those ratings aren't always right... She's a fairy that lives away from everyone else when she was little she fell in love with a human boy Okay, this sounds more familiar when they get older they lose touch Okay, seems like a common fairy tale type storyline :) lol Any other well-known actors? Shartto Copley Elle Fanning I don't recognize that name Oh, I know Elle Fanning Yeah, she is cursed Any indication on how intense elements are in the movie? Can kids really watch it? Young ones? and the only way to break the spell is love's true kiss lol...the kis! *kiss Yeah, I've watched it with mine Okay, good to know The kiss isn't from a boy though Who is the kiss from? Maleficent actually loves and cares about sleeping beauty Aurora So, she's looking after her or something? Sort of She wanted to save her, she basically caught her snooping around the forest where she lived Ah. And, naturally, there's a bad guys or bad guys. yea. What's the overall conflict?
Ok I am definitely interested in seeing this if at the very least for the cool plot they have Yeah the production was one of the many reasons to watch the movie. As much as I love movies I can believe that this escaped me lol What are some scenes you think I should watch out for?? Yeah you need check if you can watch it on demand lol. Do you enjoy science fiction films? Yes I do and if I cant do it on demand I can certainly order through my cable company. I love Star Wars all the way down to final fantasy. This should really peak my interest If you ever get an opportunity to watch the movie another key scene to look out for is.... LoLoL what is the scene Hello are you there The scene in which Cobb takes Ariadne into her first shared dreaming experience. The moment where we see one city block fold on top of another is absolutely amazing and the visual effects in this scene are wild. Did you see the new star wars? Holy cow that sounds cool now I am just ashamed I havent seen this Not yet its the only one I havent seen
I agree, with the likes of actors such as Jennifer Aniston, Morgan Freeman and Lisa Ann Walters;  it is safe to say that audience members perhaps expected a lot more of a cinematic experience with such grade A actors. About him being underrated, i do feel that it is for a fault not of his own. Writers and film directors sometimes selfishly record scenes without thinking of possible backlash to the actors they hire. True, sometimes directors and writers want to appeal to a lower common denominator of viewer. So you felt that the cast was strong? I wasn't too big of a fan of Jennifer Anniston in this. I don't think she has much range as an actress, but she does always come across as likable.

I KNOW! Sheesh, the cast of this film was AMAZING! Michael Caine, Liam Nelson, even Gary Oldman! They just stuffed it full of talent It really was but I don’t remember the lighthearted gags, more the darkness of the film. You know, I dont either, I just dont remember very much fun or silly in the movie. It was Very Serious Grimdark Business! It really was and hard to believe 13 years ago already.
Jennifer Aniston!!? wow ..... hell, also problems in love Yes, and a week playing God. and exactly what happens with Susan? I don't know. But he does take Grace to a fancy diner to tell her about a new promotion. But he upsets her because she thought he was going to propose. That's wrong, ... so they're not married I don't know about marriage, but he does use his powers to cause his coworker, Evan Baxter to humiliate himself on Air which is why Bruce was given the promotion.
I wonder if he has anymore movies coming out soon Hmmm, Scene 3 kinda spoils the movie, hahahaha They could've warned us Yeah, well atleast we don t have to watch it now

that sounds like something that could happen-wall street people are a crooked bunch, I'm familiar with that culture being formerly from New York! Oh wow, I did not know that! The rotten tomatoes gave it 7.8, that's pretty good Oh yeah, you'd probably really like it then. I would give it 8 or 9/10, I am a really big fan of this movie. Do you think you'll watch it?
Good morning. Good morning to you! We are discussing the Wolf Of Wall Street. Have you seen it? I have not seen it! Who stars in it? Leo DiCaprio, Jonah Hill, Margot Robbie Oh and Rob Reiner haha. I forgot about him. Scorsese was the director. I haven't seen Rob Reiner in a long time. Do you know who he plays? He plays Max Belfort. Yeah he usually just directs now. I saw it and it really was a good movie. Isn't it based on a true story? Yeah it was from a memoir from a Wall Street guy. What makes the story so notable? It is about his rise from being pretty much a nobody to a huge stock broker. And how it changed him into pretty much an a**. The money and all that became too much for him to handle. Dumb question but who plays the Wall Street guy? DiCaprio Not dumb if you haven't seen it! What happens to him? I don't care about spoilers, movies are about the journey for me. He starts in a small boiler room firm on Long Island doing penny stocks. And is super aggressive and starts making a lot of money. This is in the late '80s. I'm guessing he doesn't keep things strictly legal. At first he does, then not so much. So then he and Jonah Hill start their own company. And now it is definitely on the edge of legality. As they start doing really well, more young financiers want to join the company and it becomes huge. Do you know what they do specifically that gets them in trouble? If I knew anything about Wall Street I wouldn't be on MTurk. Haha. It was called the pump and dump scam. I actually don't remember exactly what that is, but it was fairly easy to understand in the film. Do they end up getting arrested? It is mostly what happens to him that the movie is about, as far as how his personality changes. He is married, but starts having affairs etc. Is he redeemed at all or does he remain totally awful? He does get arrested actually. He actually does redeem himself. He basically rats out everyone else for a reduced sentence, and serves three years.

And it takes place in Memphis? That sounds interesting I think it is. And based on a true story. he Gets enrolled by a coach who notices his athleticism That’s pretty awesome if it’s based on a true story Yes. A young man whose mom was a drug addict, who grew up on foster care, eventually playing for the Baltimore Ravens.  Very inspirational. I’ve never heard of this movie when did it come out 2009. The book was published in 2006. It got pretty good reviews I might actually watch it I like how Leigh Anne tells Michael to use his protective instincts, and that helps improve his football playing. I like these types of stories Yes, they are uplifting. Oh, I see. He lived with Leigh Anne Right. She sort of took him in, got  him enrolled in a good school. And had him work with his strengths. Ranked 98th percentile In protective instincts I did not even though that was a thing people were tested for! The family does hire a tutor for him, so he can do well in school. Me neither… he runs away? And goes back to a gang? Yes, back to his old haunt, which leads to him defending Leigh Anne from some thugs. Who are the tuohy family?

I sure did notice it getting a lot of acclaim It came out in 2013, wow I didn't realize it was already that old! Half a decade! yeah I didn't either.  yikes how do we know when to stop here or what?

Anyways it got an 89% on rotten tomatos and a CinemaScore of A+ my oldest daughter keeps mentioning wanting to watch it I feel like rotten tomatos is usually pretty accurate You should get it for her! I'm sure she would love it. It's a very classic style Disney tale but with all the modern trimmings I think that I will.  I just haven't decided if my husband and I would like it too b ut I guess we could try.  her little sister will love it too I'm sure althouogh she won't follow the plot

hi hello. You should really check out the movie Catch Me If You Can, if you get a chance. what is it about? Its about a con man who successfully cons millions of dollars by posing as an airline pilot Leonardo dicaprio plays the lead, Frank Abagnale who is the con man. wow, an airline pilot conning people.  sounds interesting I've seen a couple of movies with Leonardo in them.  I believe Titanic was his most famous one. Catch me if you can got decent reviews too. Cinema score was A- and metacritic 76/100 Sounds like a pretty good movie the cast is pretty good too. Tom Hanks and Christopher Walken are also in it.

I really can't see him as Batman either. I mean he HAD to use Kryptonite to fight superman, but still... that's the guy who can turn the entire planet to turn back time ;) I still liked the Dark Knight better with Christian Bale... Right, Batman's skills just don't stack up to Superman. Who is Zod? I've never heard of him before.
yes that is the spirit you should try it

Yes yes me too I loved it It was a great movie It has both Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks Two of my favorite actors How did you like it? i like the character the theme the story Cool I am glad it got such good reviews The critics loved it, it has a 96 percent on rotten tomatoes and a 76 on metacritic rank Abagnale, Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio) worked as a doctor, a lawyer, and as a co-pilot for a major airline -- all before his 18th birthday. That is amazing how he did that. A master of deception, he was also a brilliant forger, whose skill gave him his first real claim to fame: At the age of 17, Frank Abagnale, Jr. became the most Catch Me If You Can is a 2002 American biographical crime film directed and co-produced by Steven Spielberg from a screenplay by Jeff Nathanson. Who was your favorite character? Frank Abagnale, and yours? I liked Carl I still can't believe how he scammed 2.8 million dollars at such a young age Inspired by the true story of a brilliant young master of deception and the FBI agent hot on his trail. When he escaped the from the plane was pretty funny this movie make 352.1 million USD Do you agree? It deserved the money yes becuase story is powerful Even though Frank did wrong, I still felt a lot of sympathy for him.

I cannot believe that movie came out over 40 years ago I know I remember when I saw it in the movies I’m getting old Jack Nicholson was very good in that movie.

Great, thanks for asking! What movie are we talking about today(I can't see the document) Have you seen the great gatsby? No, unfortunately not, but I want to-my favorite book! Have hyou? Leo Decaprio is in it, right? Well i would love to tell you about it! So yes, Leonardo DiCaprio plays Jay Gatsby And Toby Macguire plays Nick Carraway He is good in almost every movie! Ah, a good cast! Is the movie close to the book? It follows along pretty well, but one critic says that to enjoy the movie, you have to put aside any literary agenda I agree with that, often the screen play is better adopted! It really shows the lavish lifestyle that Jay Gatsby had as a billionare hosting his wild parties at his house And it was cool being able to see what their rendition of the 1920s looked like, both in the life of a billionaire and a writer Oh, that sounds good, I'm sure it's a good portrayal-I always tried to imagine the scenery and that era while reading the book! The whole flapper time, liquor prohibition, etc., it was quite a time! What was your favorite thing about the book? How the author depicts these wealthy and snobbish people who could not care less about the "small" people around them but only consumed with their own greed and drive for wealth! And nothing every changed since them-just different times! ever Well I think the movie did a pretty good job portraying that Though I did find it rather interesting when Nick finds out that Jay was born penniless And that he made something of himself for his love, Daisy That would be a treat to see, I'm definitely seeing this movie soon-thank you for telling me about it! I got the feeling that Gatsby's main purpose in life was Daisy yes, his love for her it drove him to overcome everything that stood in the way-unfortunately the girl only cared for money! Do you like period piece movies? Love them: especially anything medieval and Vikings period!! how about hyou? are you still there? I do enjoy that a lot as well nice talking with you!
, sounds good . how tall are you ? i am of . what ? you are gross . you probably eat meat . why do you say that i am gross ? ll . whatever . you know . the internet is so fascinating . you are boring . okay ? but yeah , i do eat meat . i love country , but everyone that listens to it eats meat . blah
Oh ok it came out in 1975 directed by steven Spielberg its a true american classic Yeah. That was before I was born. He's a great director and the movie gets great reviews online.

what is your favorite thing about it
I wonder how old those actresses were that sang. If they were close to the ages of the characters. I do not have  that information. Me either. Just being curious. What years did Frozen come out? It came out in 2013. That sounds about right. The reviews on it are great I think. Yes it was a very popular and critically acclaimed film. I think Rotten Tomatoes gave it right around 90% approval Yes, and the CinemaScore was A+. Audiences really connected with the film. That's what makes a good film. If the audience can put themselves in it and relate to the characters. When Anna is accidentally hit by an ice blast audiences feel genuine empathy for her. You feel for both of them. The guilt Elsa felt and the fear for Anna I did not relate too much to Elsa she seemed cold. I enjoyed her at the beginning as a kid. Then she became annoying towards her powers She seemed rather self-abosorbed oh dear hello

Hi.  Do you want to watch La La Land? I do! I've seen it already but I'd be interested in watching it again It got a 92% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Yeah, it was pretty suprisingly good, I think. You don't really see that kind of movie these days Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone were both very believable It stars Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling.  Of course, some have called it a "fizzy fantasy". haha yes. I think that it might have been over-hyped a bit, but it was definitely enjoyable their romance felt fairly realistic to me. but I also agree with the critics who said that neither of them was particularly good at singing or dancing Well, a critic did say they lacked depth as characters. I agree with that But it's funny because I think, in a way that was the whole point of it. they were kind of blinded by the glamour of everything so it was just a shallow romantic fling that they had but they thought it was far deeper than it actually was. Yeah, I read that the title refers to music, Los Angeles, and to being out of touch with reality. Definitelhy like, they were kind of in "la la land". out of touch with that was actually happening did you see the it? There was the scene at the beginning where Sebastian is fired for disobedience.  And he storms out right past Mia.
i have seen so many lately
Do you think it was to dark to be a fairy tale? Most fairy tale moves are bright and bubbly. That is true. Although if you think of hansel and gretel for example, where the children get eaten, or red riding hood where the wolf ate the grandma. lol. a lot of times fairy tales can be dark. Do you generally like dark tales? Since, Maleficent is a Disney film. You think they would make it more soft since children are the target audience of their movies. True fairy tales are dark fantasy like this move. Yes, I'm thinking that this one was not targeted to children though. What do you think about Angelina Jolie as the lead role?

Super talented for sure. Although I'm not sure I know any of the other cast members who acted with him in this movie! It's so sad about the puppy death The storyline for this movie was so farfetched yet they really pulled it off Anytime an animal dies it's a tear jerker. Yeah, it does seem a bit unrealistic though. Do you think people would actually seek vengeance over a puppy and stealing a car? You have to see the movie really to get it. It's a crazy plot. There's a swank hotel for all the hitmen that is kind of like a "safe" base. OH. Gotcha! What do you think about the humor in this movie? Are you generally a fan of action/violent movies? Dark, farfetched yet has humor to it. I never really go for action movies do you? By action I mean violent. The humor is super low key. Not usually! I'm not sure I liked the humor of it. I think there's over 50 people killed within the first 20 minutes of the movie. Super violent. Guns everywhere. And it ends with the same thing? With the "impossible task" given by Viggo? Well it leaves you with knowing there is going to be a sequal. sequel. Sorry spelling. Oh you're fine no worries! Do you think you are going to ever watch it or no? I think when John travels to Iosef's "safe house" to kill him, it really brings a good end to the story LOL probably not It definitely is one of those movies that are not loved by everyone.

Did she win? obviously she won... because she is the wonder woman yes villian died Oh well I have never read about her so I wouldn't know I would like to see it perhaps I like the fight vs good and evil Before she was Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot), she was Diana, princess of the Amazons, trained to be an unconquerable warrior. Raised on a sheltered island paradise, Diana meets an American pilot (Chris Pine) who tells her about the massive conflict that's raging in the outside world. Convinced that she can stop the threat, Diana leaves her home for the first time. Fighting alongside men in a war to end all wars, she finally discovers her full powers and true destiny. basically that was the story Oh that sounds like a great story. I like a girl who can keep up and kick butt.

It's got great actresses. rachel McAdams, Amanda Seyfried, Lindsay Lohan. Oh Nice! What is the storyline for the movie? Even Rotten Tomatoes gave it a good score and named it in it's Top 50 Greatest Teen Comedies Oh then it must be pretty good. I think I will definitely check it out the next time I have some free time. Storyline - there's a new girl in a high school, awkward, and finds a questionable group of frenemies. Then shenanigans. I like shenanigans! Me too! This movie was written by Tina Fey. I didn't know that, but I like it even more now. Yea Tina Fey is really funny. So is the movie! Are there any other ratings other than Rotten Tomato? Lindsay Lohan plays the main role of the awkward new girl CinemaScore is A- So it's pretty much consistent across the board. When was Mean Girls released? This came out in 2004. Oh so this is an older movie. it is, but it is still popular and VERY quotable So the movie still holds up? I see people quote it often Absolutely! That's cool, most old movies don't hold up too well after time.

its such a simple plot too. even though its unrealistic. its almost all in the title. What do you think about the overall plot? Yes, that is true! Do you like comedy movies? its basic, and you have to suspend some disbelief (as in the parents would have noticed much sooner), but its really well executed. I like comedy movies in general. what did you think of the scene where they miss the alarm and have to scramble to get to the airport? Yeah well the McCalliter family forgetting their youngest son is a bit too much but most viewers get past that. I love the dynamic of the family in the day of departure. I could totally imagine them getting out the door without him in a panic.

Home Alone and yours? I wasn't given a movie to read about. I'm supposed to ask about your movie and decide if it is worth watching. So on that note, what would you say makes Home Alone 2 worth watching based on what you read? This movie has average rating of 5.5/10 Do you usually watch movies with good/bad rating? It sounds totally average then. I've been surprised at some "poorly rated" movies being good, but I've also found some with positive reviews that were trash. How much stock do you put into ratings? I put some time into ratings
Morgan Freeman plays God and Jennifer Anniston plays a woman named Grace Connelly. Oh wow. Morgan Freeman is God? Sounds fun. By the way who is Bruce and why is he Almighty as the title suggests?
Chris pine was also a valuable asset in the movie dont you agree ? Yes, I really enjoyed him as Steve Trevor and thought he had great chemistry with Gal Gadot I love all dc comics movie, when i watch these movie its a distraction from everyday routine. I agree I thought that the fight scenes in the movie were particularly well done.  Did you enjoy that aspect of the movie? Definitely, the quality and special effects blew me away I particularly enjoy watching female superheros roles being that they are not as common don't you agree? Yes, I think it's great that the superhero movies are featuring female characters as well as the male ones and I really enjoy that I thought the movie did a great job of filling in the back-story and giving us insight into Diana's history and motivations.  Did you find that interesting too? Yes, The movie really did a great job in proving viewers a detail explanation on her life. I really enjoyed the fact that she was fighting for peace.

i thought it was pretty funny too. I'm not usually a fan of jim carrey, his sense of humor doesn't do it for me. But this one wasn't too bad. It was funny that Jim's character Bruce had the chance at being 'God' for a week. yea. i liked the concept of the movie. definitely shows that being god isn't an easy job! Morgan freeman is always a great actor too. He can play just about any role, I think he did a fantastic job. yea, he is a great actor. his sense of humor is really relatable I've seen him in other serious movies, but nothing comedic. Well done.

Hi! What movie will we talk about? Hey, we're talking about Iron Man Ok, great. Who is in it? It has Robert Downey Jr, Jon Favreau (who also directed), Gwyneth Paltrow and Terrance Howard. Cool. Do you have any information about the plot? It's based off of the Marvel comic book hero, a master engineer who builds himself an exoskeleton suit. He then uses it to be a "super hero". Do you know what the reviews are like? It's regarded as a good movie and well-liked by fans. Critics seem to like it as well, with a Metacritic score of 79/100. Sounds like a pretty good movie! Have you seen it yourself? I have seen it. I think it's pretty good. And a good start of the whole giant Marvel franchise. Yeah, I always heard that it was one of the better superhero movies out there There are two sequels, right? Yes, two sequels to the Iron Man series. And he's in the other Marvel movies as well. In the new document I'm given, it describes the beginning of the movie. Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) is at a weapons demonstration when he gets ambushed and abducted. He's taken to a hideout in a cave of a terrorist group. A fellow captive who is a doctor saves his life by implanting an electro magnet into Stark's chest to keep shrapnel from killing him. Oh, and that is how he becomes a superhero? Yea, that's "Iron Man's" origin story, how Tony gets the glowing circle on his chest, why he needs it the rest of his life. What role does Jon Favreau play? I know he has been in some of his other movies he's directed He's Tony's assistant and friend. It's not a major role.

Yes, his traps were hilarious. Yeah, I guess so. They were the kind of traps that any 8-year-old could devise Yes, they were hilarious though. That's where I disagree lol I'm suprised they haven't done a reboot of Home Alone. If he had tens of thousands of dollars and a crew of movie special effects people Yes. They are rebooting everything else Oh Buzz. Buzz, Buzz. And that tarantula, lol. LOL do you normally watch movies with bad ratings? Probably...not realizing it, lol. I try to research first.

I havent seen it in soooo long The old neighbor guy was scary at first too. Sadly, I don't remember the old neighbor. Poor kid, wakes up, alone, on Christmas. No family in sight. No santa. In the days before cell phones I agree the film first half was flat and unsurprising. I saw it coming a mile away.

Yep, I can take a look at it. Is there any other well-known actor/est in the movie? I remembe John Leguazamo I hope I spelled it right. Michael Nygvist
rick and morty are so interesting i will include them in my book .
i definitely am thinking about seeingit I think they overestimated British role in that time... just saying ;) that's why I asked You if You were British :) I didn't want to offend You
Very but its mostly hand-to-hand karate style fights but there are a lot of people that get shot. I don't remember if it was over the top but I don't think so. Do you typically like movies like that? Probably not.  I love action films, but I'm not big on violence or puppies being killed.  Plus, the last Keanu film I enjoyed was Speed, and that was over 20 years ago! Though I did enjoy the film Keanu, but that was a comedy about a kitten named after the actor.  ;) Ha, they don't show the puppy in this and I have seen that and its great. Who else stars in John Wick?  Any female characters in it? Yes, Adrianne Palicki plays a female contract killer, and Alfie Allen (GoT) plays a bad guy Reeves is pretty funny in it, it definitely has humor element thrown in and it is well done. They trash a lot of SUVs They also steal his car, I'm pretty sure it was a 70 Chevelle so he is a bit bitter. I can't picture Alfie Allen as a villain, but I do like Adrianne Palicki.  She was great in Agents of Shield, and she's in Orville right now.  She can hold her own against Keanu. Men and their cars. Hee hee. How long ago was the movie released?
I think it would be hard. They are well loved. Who do you think would be killed off? I know some of their contracts are up, so killed off may not be right, more like "explain away" I think the Hulk feels like a forced character. What do you think? He is, but if he's in there as slap stick/cheese factor it's fine I think the problem is he needs to be the humor. Thor Ragnarok did this and there were hints in Avengers I love the alpha male conflicts with CP and IM.
right the sheep whe was the mayors assistant is in on it and trying to make zootopia just for the herbivorous yes he was trying so hard at first to hold it together oh yes bellweather was the sheeps name. there was a nother movie that was really good that is an animation you should check out its called Son Of Bigfoot 2017 have you seen it? i have not see that It is so good and very suspenseful so you know who does the voices? any big names i think your new German Sheppard would like to watch zootopia with you. maybe snack on some carrots lol he hasnt had carrots yet hes 8 weeks old only thing close is sweet potato I don't know the voice over actors on that one zootopia hasGinnifer Goodwin and Jason Bateman as the voices
Yes, it is based off of Jordan's Belfort's memoir so a lot of the things depicted in the movie happened to him in real life.
i guess that is true , so you want to fake a real pond ? xcuse me ? your question is baffling .
i heard that taylor swift donated money to texas . she sure has enough to do such a thing i have been out on a hike today sband loves hiking !
What was your favorite part? I like the time when you pretended to  be the piolet Pilot* it seems like a crazy concept but i like how it all rolls together Big fan of all the women in the film too He was brilliant.

True. I enjoyed the scene where Leigh Anne found out that Michael had high protective instincts as it tied together the family elements and the football elements of the movie And how she went on the football field to show him i was disturbed by the scene where Michael returned to his home town and almost joined a gang from home

Iron Man (titled Iron Man: iron man in Spanish America) is a superhero movie. I know that you haven't answered any of my questions who are the actors Robert Downey Jr. como Tony Stark / Iron Man: I like Robert Downey Jr has a broad cast The film was directed by Jon Favreau, with a screenplay by Stan Lee, Hawk Ostby, Art Marcum and Matt Holloway. are there special effects? certainly in many scenes has it won any wards? awards sorry if it is a long list of recognitions for example oscar of better visual effects and better sound editing very interesting who is the bad guy?

Exactly he was good. I like movies with Amazonian Warriors I just love the whole world and idea of these amazonian women created by zeus to protect mankind. Yeah and the Island Themyscira is cool The training is pretty cool too. I love the idea of the lasso and godkiller sword. When Antiope sacrifices himself to save her is cool I think you mean herself, and yes it is very touching. The chemist to me isabel maru was so creepy. I think the idea of deadly gas like the mustard gas is just very disturbing. Yes, is kind of creepy but for a movie is lethal and fast.

Jim Carrey seems to do well with these type of plots. Liar Liar was hilarious. In that movie, he is a liar who suddenly cannot tell a lie. literally. Ha ha. Prayer email automated reply system! I completely forgot that that was the plot of Liar Liar! That's funny. Similar concept. Bruce Almighty was released in 2013 - 15 years ago! I imagine Liar Liar is even older than that. Yeah, its an old one. So does he save the world at the end or something? I'll probably check it out, being that I liked Liar Liar.

she read in the paper that noah finished building the house.  I think the real hero is his father! selling their land for him to get the girl back. Allie then goes to Noah That was a very touching part of the story. It finally made Allie's mom give her the letters. Her mother realized that she couldn't stop Allie from seeing and being with Noah. okay, so allie is not with her lover. I am glad that Allie ultimately chose Noah, they belong together. i hope so! Lon didn't seem all that upset anyway. Noah treated her much better. yeah very nice story very touching and love at real sight!

OK.  I thought that Leonardo DiCaprio was in it. I am fallowing. Please, continue. Jonah Hill stars as his business partner Donnie some critics claim that the film is an irresponsible glorification rather than a satrical takedown. OK. Was this movie based on true live story? yes the wolf of wall street is based on a true story in 1987 Yes, I thought so. Thank you. What else can you tell me about it. Belfort finds his career terminated following black monday and takes a job at a brokerage firm selling penny stocks. The plot sounds interesting.Continue, please. thanks to his aggressive pitching style and the high commissions, Jordan makes a small fortune.
i am diabetic so my food choices are limited hat sucks how long have you been diabetic ?
sorry to hear that . if you do not want to join a cult then do not i will not but i am afraid of marriage now
what kind of museums inspire you most ?
I see. I like the fact that they are both doing what they love in the movie and in turn fall in love with each other because of following their dreams. I agree, I don't know why people resist love so much though.  They have such animosity for a while when they are so clearly attracted to each other. Right?! I also find it admirable that they are trying to make a movie based on loving Jazz. To be honest that is one type of music I just can't get into.
cool do you go hiking ? i like the outdoors ope . but i would love to learn self defense someday . its a good skill to have
i lost use of my legs when i wrecked the car my friend bought me i am sorry that is too bad ! its ok . i am adjusting pretty well hat is good to hear , what have you been doing ? i have not done much today . how about you ? working , about to head to the gym
I am okay. My grand kids like to watch them so I watch with them. My husband got me stuck to them. So, any particular movie do you like? I like the Batman, all of them. How about you? We like Wonder Woman.  I have three grand daughters. Awww, I like Wonder Woman too. I like to watch superhero movies.  I do not want to take life too seriously. I know what you mean, if you do you'll just end up getting hurt in the long run. It takes your mid off of everyday things too. Totally agree. Do you and your grand daughters watch any other super hero movies? We watched Batman movie in the past. I think that Rotten Tomatoes gave Wonder Woman a great review Yes.  I will watch it again. So will I, I will probably watch it with my niece and nephews next time. Boys will like it too.  When they are small they are less biased. Very true, it's when they grow up that you have to worry about. Do you watch movies at home? Yes, I would rather watch them at because it cost too much to go to the theater anymore. I used to like to go to movie theaters.  However, with various news about shootings, I decide not to. I don't blame you there, you can't trust anyone. Also sad that you can't go out and have fun with the grand kids without watching over your shoulder. I only bring one or two kids out.  I do not trust strangers anymore. I don't blame you, this world is becoming a scary place. One reason why I choose not to have kids. Are things getting bad or are they same but we know more due to the internet?
just about to put my daughter down for a nap , you ? doing a lil multi tasking ? hat is the life of a mom lol ! being a mom is undervalued in my opinion it can be . my mom worked as an rn and took care of my siblings and i .

Not quite.  It is a Great White Shark, but it is on the larger end of the shark spectrum. After the first attack, the police chief wants to close the beaches, but the mayor doesn't let him because he thinks it will ruin the economy and tourism of the town. That is totally awesome! You stated that it won some awards? Or was it only nominated?

a lot of people like it...it's got a decent rotten tomatoes score as well. 78% Though apparently that website can be misleading, because it only tells you the percent of people who "liked" it Still, that's a solid rating Have you watched movies before similar to it? The film has some great scenes (spoiler alert) where Leo's character gets into the whole sex and drugs aspect of the stockbroker life. I don't think there is anything quite like it. It's a black comedy and there aren't a ton of those I don't think. The ones that are out there, don't deal with this subject matter. do you think you are going to check it out?

i there , i know we have never talked much but i think you are pretty great hank you . that is very kind o problem , i know i seem quiet but i like to speak my mind what do you do for a living ?
y there ! hows it going ? ?
whoa I haven't even heard of half of those. are they powerful like superman and ironman? Yeah, almost as powerful but with different abilities, theres even a movie about each one of them as well. All part of the Marvel comics universe of movies
so you do not want to hit the bars , go meet some women with me ? i would not even know how , i am kind of tall and geeky , do not get out much i could help you get some dates too . i enjoy cooking healthy meals , get you in shape well , my dad being a cop , kind of scares everyone off
quite well . thanks for asking . i will be even better when i hit the beach ! oh , beaches , those are such fun . i am surrounded by fields of corn instead . i love corn . its one of my fads . i am a vegan ! hat is not so easy . i am a pastatarian i just love pasta of all kinds .
i am best . can i lift you ? will you be my wife ?
hat is a good aspiration . do you train for it ? when i can running the store always keeps me busy it seems . how long did it take you to become a manager ? few years , do you like your job ? i have just started , learning the ropes . its good for now . struggling college girl , stick with it , it pays the bills .

That to me is very harsh However, when Hiccup almost drowns trying to free toothless, Stoick saves them both, reconciling with his son Did you like the ending? how they make Hiccup and Toothless basically equal? (both missing something vital?) How do you feel about the rotten tomatoes 98% score?
i heard that part 4 was in the making. wonder if they are going to continue with the little girl that has them now. cant wait to see what trouble they get into next. lol who's your favorite character by the way? This series could go forever like the Simpsons. Probably Woody he is real funny. It may just. but i hope they dont do too many because it is hard to keep up such a caliber of work. im tied between woody and buzz. Ya me also, They could make a cartoon series on this but it may not be as good. It's great for the entire family. i feel the same. the shorts that they do once in a while a pretty good. Maybe they could do a movie that is not a cartoon with real actors the ones that play the actual roles. cartoon format fits well for this. i dont think it would work as well or translate as well as spongebob out of the water did.
how cool . i own a business . what do you do with homeless people ? basically keep them in my house like human pets . because i am that damn smart . i find that insane . i enjoy sushi . whatever . what simple business do you own , lay person ? i own a simple business of selling things . i find that insane . are you taller than me ? my height is 6 feet . i am about the same size . if you were homeless i would reject you . i only collect small humans . well if you were homeless i would give you water .

I love movies with military technology Same. As for the ending, Leonardo Dicaprio and another character build a new world, and the other character commits suicide to try to "wake up" after some confusion with the dream worlds. Leonardo has to flee the country and leave his children behind because he is blamed for the death.

Which is massive - that's a lot of money for a movie, but I suppose since it was shot in Australia, it cost a little more. Would you watch it again? I love the story of Gatsby, though - he is the American tragedy. Absolutely. The movie is more of an experience than a movie - especially when you watch the party scenes. They are so over the top and extravagant. It takes place during the Roaring Twenties In New York! Which was a very happening place to be during that time period.
It's crazy how manipulative "the plastics" were and how easy it was to get Cady sucked into their drama right away. I know. And every time I hear the name the Plastics, it cracks me up. And Janis plotting revenge was also funny. I wonder what it would be like to move to another country while in high school. That must have been so hard. Talk about culture shock! I can't either. I moved when I was in elementary school and that was really hard. I can't imagine being a homeschooled person and ending up there. Yeah. You're given all these new rules and have to learn how to live amongst a whole different culture. New words, terms, social customs and standards, norms, everything. Cady probably didn't even know what a Burn Book was. Like you said, massive culture shock! That scene with Principal Duvall was crazy! Definitely a bit over the top, but I think the message is clear. Yeah. It also surprised me when Regina got hit by the school bus and broke her spine.
i have 2 computer displays at my job impressive ! i could watch the game and edit my fantasy roster
do you have any pets ?
plot is really solid it stays interesting from start to finish always a plus. chessy ending or is it decent?  sometimes these movies can get predictable the ending is similar to many movies since the bag guy looses pathetically, there want much struggle in power gotcha.  wonder if this is on netflix between opposing sides im not sure, I do see it on hulu. but I stoppod using netfilx. you might find the whole movie o youtube also didn't think about youtube good idea anything else of interest about the movie? yeah, when looking for movies on youtube, never search using the movie name, instead use the actors name to get all movies they have made.
Stephen stayed bitter and cold to the end...sad He got what he deserved
Yes I have and enjoyed it a lot It sounds like something I would enjoy watching with my family. Do you know when it was released? Great! It was released in 2016, around the holiday season Do you know if any streaming services have the movie available? I'm not sure, but it's always a good bet to check Netflix if you have subscription. I might have seen it on there. How long is the run time? I think I saw the trailer for it before. As far as I remember it is just under 2 hours I think that is a good time for my toddler to stay intrigued.. Definitely. You will enjoy it too It sounds like it Are you able to finish conversation?
i also live in a place far far away ok , i shall call you luke do you have any siblings ? 17 maybe more , my dad got around . you ? ve a lot , youngest of 8 kids over here

oh that is too bad , i need both my arms to cook my dinner i really love cooking i need my arms for farming , how am i going to hoe without two arms . hat is wonderfully awful , my dad sells used cars , and i need two arms to fish least i can do my hobby , hiking , i only need two legs for that . i am a pretty pleasant person to be around , my dogs think so should have listened to my parent and used my college degree for an office job . i should have explored my ambition for cooking i have a parrot named todd , he is a real talker . do you like sports ? o but i like my dog pepperoni
i am doing great although my feet hurt from waiting tables at a cafe i bet that is a tough job . i am in real estate when did you become a vegetarian ? what influenced you ? i do not always eat vegetarian , it is about my health
it is hard to swim since i am missing a toe , pinky .
you got that right ! what grade do you teach ?
I love him!!!  He's very talented a versatile. The movie has alot of bad critical responses because they compared it to Dark Knight and said that the action scenes were not made realistic for fans of superman or batman and says that they did not stick to any real things that you would see them do in older movies. So in my opinion i would say if your a long time fan of superman or batman this would not be an ideal movie for you.
It really is
reat ! ankles swollen . i need 5 months of bed rest . you sing ? ything but country music . health condition ? reat ! twins in me . you like charlie pride ? wow another charlie fan . twins ? that s a health condition
Yeah I agree It looks like they get busted for all the partying and scamming and what not this final scene shows the main guy turning on his co-workers to escape a long prison term Looks like everything falls apart in the end
i ! helloooo ! you have got to listen to imagine dragons , i bet my life . its the best ! very interesting i sure will . do you have a job ? i am a musician but i also work as an accountant . how about you ?
I love Idris Elba. And Jason Batman is so versatile. I'll definitely check it out. it is a great comedy Can't wait to check it out. is it rated pg? i am not sure but probably Cool. I want to take my kids. that sounds good it is funny and has a nice storyline Did it come out last year? 2016 Okay. I can't think of anything else I need to know the characters are all kinds of different animals like Disney? oh wait, is it animated? yes animated oh wow. that's important. Maybe I'll pass. i think it would be great to take the kids to although 98% is pretty high for RT Yeah. I might see it for them. Does it have songs? they will like the comedy and all of the animals yeah the will
That's cool, so it's sort of a biographical movie? The next scene is when Britain declares war on Germany, Turing goes to work at a place called Bletchley Park that is trying to decode the Nazi's Enigma Machine.  Yes, it's a historical drama. Do you want to hear the plot? Does it mention how accurate the movie is as opposed to real-life events; that's why I was asking if it was biographical as opposed to simply historical? Oh.  One of the critics says it rearranges the time sequences and invents fictional characters. Thanks for the clarification, are there any more excerpts? Yes, the plot sounds really good.  Turing manages to decrypt the Nazi code machine, but the Nazis change the code every day.  So they all realize they can't act on every day's decrypted messages or the Nazis will know that their code machine is useless. Interesting, does it mention how it's resolved, or does it leave you sort of on the cliff?
i rap for a barbershop quartet ? hat is cool ! you like to climb ever ?
hat is to bad . what happened ? high standards . mostly just outshined by all my younger siblings .
Yes it was very clever, I also attribute the success of the movie to John Lasseter's directing style. He did a great job making all the characters come together.
ine is blue also and mine is cinderella
ood evening ! anything interesting going on with you ? i am making some chai tea right now yum , is it purple ? lol , that is my favorite color . my snake is purple . i also have a dog hat is awesome ! my car is a purple lamborghini . i really like the color black . i have a lot of black clothes hat is so chic . ask me about my ideal woman hint hint i also love plants and i draw a lot you sure keep busy . are you anything like cher in the movie clueless ? yeah i try to keep busy all the time i have to work a lot , since i have no room left on my credit cards . me either i wish i was rich it sucks i hear that , but we do what we can .
i am listening to rock music and editing the photos i took today on my hike . you ?
I would think that the Disney worked so long so to get it so right; the songs, the scripts. I can't agree with you more. The great script and songs attracted not only kids, but also adults. It was such a fan family movie. The movie started with the sad story. Their parents had sad sudden death Now i have to do some reserach on Howard Ashman. It is amazing that one person had such a penetrating effect.
no, the software doesn't stop. have done this before. gonna sign off! oh OK. laters.
interesting . . . is that related to your work ?
Me too; I've watched a few of the other Avengers movies since. I only recently got to see Dr. Strange Were all your movie choices from the Marvel Cinematic Universe series? No, they weren't, though they were about the same time frame, as long as they meant the 2012 Jaws movie, and not the 70's version. Oh interesting. At least we got a good film with great reviews. It's got appeal for so many people - those of us who grew up with Superman action figures can take our kids who now play Marvel video games :) That's true, even though they introduce some new characters. Did you have favorites growing up? We had a video rental store in the next town with limited selections - it was Superman or Star Wars - episodes IV, V, and VI. I remember the Hulk had a TV show for a while. Yes! Video rentals. Ahhh the good old days. :) That was our friday night fun/ fights. Deciding if we would get a comedy, action, horror, or something else.
you get around . my dad founded the communist party branch in france . odd coincidence . wow that is quite interesting why are you going to paris ? do they even serve french fries there ? vacation , i am gonna use some vacation time after working for 2 years at my job sounds like a well deserved break ! with or without fries , lol . yeah it is and i really want to get the most out of it . i hope you have fun . if you sometime need a party planner , i got you .

Hi, so we are talking about the movie Frozen Kristen Bell was great as Anna in the movie! I have seen this movie several times and liked it, I would enjoy seeing the broadway show I never knew that it was based off "The Snow Queen" by Hans Christian Andersen. I would also love seeing it turned into a Broadway show Of course, the reindeer Sven and Olaf the snowman steal the show! Do you enjoy movies of this genre?
It has a 53/100 metacritic and a 6.1/10 average on rotten tomatoes
wow . . . i cant do that . i enjoy relaxing and fishing
well it is a crime . just saying . ot necessarily , but if i stole something that was originally mine ?
lol , dragons are not real , you should seek counseling
Besides Robert Downey Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow, Jeff Bridges, and Terrence Howard all star in the movie. Is it good?  How does it compare to the Batman franchise? I did enjoy the movie.  I think Ironman is just as entertaining as the Batman franchise but isn't as dark as batman. Interesting!  How many Ironman films have there been?  Quite a few, right? Four I believe...quite a lot, but on par with superhero movies I was surprised to see that Jon Favreau directed this film Did he?  I like Jon Favreau's stuff.  I think he's hilarious in the movies I've seen him in. Is there a lot of comedy in this movie? He is a funny actor and apparently likes comic books. There is a fair amount of comedy.  No more, no less, than other superhero films Rotten Tomatoes has it at 94%, so its a pretty popular film I didn't know that about him.  What's the best scene of the movie? That's a really great rating considering how controversial some movies are scored.

It looks like their whole family plan to spend Christmas in Paris but somehow Kevin or McAuley Culkin wasn’t able to make it and didn’t notice till after the plane Yes the wind knocked the power out and the family rushed out of the house leaving him behind. Yeah I guess that would be super confusing you went through stressful situations so I can kind of see how that can happen if Kevin as punished but no one blamed Buzz which was pretty unfair.

In the end, he does 3 years of cushy time and gets paid to teach other people how to sell unethically . . . 'Merica! and  he smuggles CASH out of the country how does he butter them up to give him sweet time Even though I haven't seen the movie, I feel like I've read the stories. I wonder if the people he thought would give him a kickback.. I think I may watch this.

Hello Okay It is a movie by Guillermo Del Toro Is it a drama, action, comedy...? I would say a bit drama, a bit action. It's listed as a fantasy drama. It's set in 1962 Baltimore and follows a mute custodian at a government labratory. OH ok that sounds like a good mix i love drama The mute custodian falls in love with a captured humanoid amphibian creature.

1 hour and 49 minutes At least it's not too long, there's certainly movies that are hard to finish because they are 2+ hours. Have you personally seen the movie?
i hate cleaning too . i really hate cleaning the bathroom . i am with you there for sure . i have a mountain of laundry to fold and put away . you must not have done laundry in a long time since you have no kids ? it has been awhile . my husband has a lot of clothes . some men like to change clothes multiple times a day anyway . lol

I don't think it's the best, per say, but it was definitely good. I mean just about every Disney movie has music in it, this one most certainly had a great deal of catchy songs, The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast will forever be my favorites. It's an alright script, but like I said, it's a typical Disney movie, someone falls in love, there's villains, there's magic, there's singing and dancing, problems to overcome. I would probably give it a B+ rating instead of an A+, but that's just me. Yes it is right. Personally I love Pixar movies and this one seems to have the same approach of one of then, maybe this is why I liked it. What about the end of history did you expected more?
I have seen this movie but it’s been years ago I do remember being very funny Who was in it? Did it feature Jason Momoa shirtless? Could you maybe type a littel faster? Or stop being a bot? I want to see a movie. I could watch one waiting for this bot to do something. What was dunny? Funny What keywords will trigger the bot? Jesus fuck, why am I wasting my time? I'm tired of surveys that abuse me. I did not get the other user in the chat room "Still acting normally"?  He's stopped responding! Oh, oh, what was the name of the movie? what was the name of the movie? Fuck.

Hello there. How did you like The Blind Side? I'm  not sure that I've seen it. Have you? I see, I have. It was rather enjoyable, though not an objectively excellent movie. It's a sports film, and is based on a book. How does that sound to you? Well, I'm not into sports or reading. lol So, pretty boring! Ha I do like Tim McGraw, I see he was in it

Does the creature look natural/normal or is it monster like? It makes us believe she lived happily ever after. The creature was definitely monster like Like from a 50's sci fi show oh ok

I did not realize that either! I did know that Tim Allen played Buzz Lightyear. It was great casting and created a believable friend relationship between him and Woody. Indeed. The scene where they Buzz is given as a gift at the party is a really cute way to introduce a character - but I guess as a toy, it's a wonderful idea Yes! I could not agree more. It is a beautiful representation of friendship as the work together to be reunited with their friend Andy. I think it really does give kids the right idea. So true! it's ingenious that the toys use baby monitors to communicate back and forth - adorable and something kids can easily relate to. Agreed! I love the added characters such as the slinky dog and Rex. I believe that it added many different personalities to the movie!

It's one of those movies I like to watch when it comes on again on Netflix.  Did you realize it is actually a true story? Yes, I think of the movie whenever I used to see that player in the NFL Michael Oher or something? Used to play on the Ravens and Panthers I think Not sure if he's still in the league. Yes, that's right.  I am always rooting for him when I see him now. And, I don't know for sure about Sandra Bullock getting the Oscar, she might have -- I do know she got great reviews.  The other actor I loved in it was Tim McGraw.  I know him only as a singer -- had no idea he could act! Oh yeah, now I remember him! Not a big fan of country music, but I do know who he is though. I loved how the end credits show the actual family. I still remember that as well. It's always surprising to see how movies get reviewed.  The review site Cinema Score gave the film an A+, but MetaCritic only gave it a 53/100. Oh yeah, I remember that about the actual family -- very cool Did you know that Phil Collins's daughter Lily was in the movie too? She was pretty good, she played the sister.
I feel old discussing this movie because I was 10 when it came out, have you seen Toy Story? I have I was 12 when it came out. I still watch this movie today when it comes on. one of my favorite Disney Pixar movies actually. have you watched other movies by Disney Pixar? I have Like, most of them Not surprised it got a real high rating from rotten tomatoes. Has a good story and I thikn it was the first fully animated movie made. Me either. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen were great choices as voice-overs in this movie so I'm not surprised by the critics response either. I Didnt realize that Don Rickels voices Potato Head! and Jim Varney was instantly recognizable as the slinky dog I didn't either until I read this document! John Lessetter is the same director of some of the other Disney Pixar movies I believe, isn't he? I think several I was also just young enough to still play with toys like the movie shows, so it was really relatable at the time and now I have two young kids, so its funny to them too My daughter still has a Jesse doll from this movie... music by Randy Newman.. the music was a perfect fit for this movie.. you got a friend in me, was a song that sticks with me from this movie.. Oh yea, definitely. haha -- I freaked out when I was a kid and Woody accidentally knocked Buzz out of the window. Hah yep. They made genuinely attachable characters. My brother actually went to halloween as buzz lightyear recently. They stick to you they do, Buzz Lightyear was popular... even the aliens at the Pizza Planet became a hot item oh Sid Phillips. the neighbor kid... he was a wild one Sorry, got busy there no problem...
ot as much as people think , but it can get pretty rainy .
Leonardo DiCaprio, Jonah Hill, Margot Robbie It is a great cast. DiCaprio is phenomenal in it. I love most things Leonardo is in This was released a while back? It was released in 2013. It was a very dark comedy, written by Martin Scorsese. I think I know the story it was based on. Surprisingly not the greatest reviews/scores. 78% from rotten tomatoes, 75/100 metsdcore Metascore* Oh weird, I thought it got some nominations? It is essentially about a firm on Wall Street, run by DiCaprios character. They did a lot of shady business, lots of corruption and fraud, which ultimately led to their demise. I believe it did get nominations! It sounds interesting Is it on netflix? It is based on a memoir. Belfort, the stockbroker, is an incredibly cunning, convincing character who's charm and smarts really get him very far!
yeah . . flash is great . my two brothers and one sister collected comics growing up .
interesting . i do not watch a whole lot of tv myself . oh , i watch it all the time . what do you like ? i am really into video games . and i love sports cars ! oh i like video games too . much better than the outside . yeah , i do not get out much . not too many friends either . only three .
No i havent but i have heard good things. Yes, it actually got a A+ CinemaScore and 89% on Rotten Tomatoes which is awesome. That is pretty good! Have you seen it yourself? I have several times. It has a princess on a journey so it's comedy and adventure. The animation looks beautiful. Yep! One critic said it was the best animated musical to come from Disney in a long time. i love adventure themed movies. the characters seem well developed The characters are great and include a princess, a iceman, a reindeer, and a snowman. You should definitely check it out! Also a colony of trolls! I heard the snowman is suppose to be funny and has a good voice actor. i love trolls And the princess has cryokinetic magic which is awesome. I'm not sure who the actor is for the snowman, but the princesses have Kristen Bell and Idina Menzel who are both great. Oh ive heard good things about them! Did you like the soundtrack? I do. The songs are broadway-style and one critic said it was destined to end up on Broadway The main plot is where Elsa the princess accidentally unleashes an eternal winter on her town and then runs away. So they have to go find her. I'm very convinced to watch it now. It seems like the movie has been very inspiring for children. Great for children and also just families in general. You should definitely check it out. Especially since you like trolls. :)
yeah it makes my blonde hair look great .
ing out is good ! try paddle boarding sometime . hanks i will
well , i am not her ahahah .
What would you rate it, from 1 to 10? an eight (: Do you think Leonardo DiCaprio did a really great job at the beginning of the movie when he was a French Teacher? Tell me what you think. I really enjoyed that scene. I liked that it was based on a true story. What did you think of the person the film is based on?
i just took a drive with my wife , which i enjoy . how about you ? oh that sounds lovely . i wish i had learned how to drive and had a wife
The movie was way to scary ahaha Hm so I guess we are to talk about these opening scenes. I thought it was an excellent opening that got to the point but also set the stage. Kind of had that feeling that oh these guys don't know what they are getting into. yeah ahaha.. It also kind of plays on peoples' fear of sharks especially at night. Where just doing something for fun turns into a nightmare. weell at first the chiep police dont like to believes that thers a shark on the beach.. yeah but I belive that sharks dont eat people they were just protecting their selves for as they thought intruders in their teritory.. Oh yeah they thought it was a boating accident. Well probably didn't want to induce panic. Turns out it was a giant man eating shark after another dies. Yeah I wonder if this book/movie was sparked by shark attacks? yeahh.. I also think so.. I did not know who was the author of the novel maybe he or she has a personal experienced or somewhat./. Says Peter Benchley. Dunno if he wrote any other novels based on the subject or if the movies took their own path ahh maybe spielberg added some sceens for the movie to be much more intence. Haha much more intense than this description. Kind of does the movie an injustice to pile it all into a couple paragraphs
ok that makes sense

He's seven years old. nice is mturk  is your primary work No, I do this on the side. I like the message of this movie. It teaches kids to follow their dreams. Do you generally watch movies with (good/bad) ratings? Do you agree with the rating of the movie? I tend to watch movies with good ratings. I definitely agree with the ratings of this movie. it seem like very popular movies Definitely when to finish conversation I'm not sure. I think we've talked about the movie enough.

Yinsen probably didn't consider himself physically able to control the suit. Pepper spends too much time on Goop looking up alternative medicines and such. Just kidding. I could fully see Pepper Potts donning a suit and being a hero. Heheh. It seems that only powerful men get suits, including Obidiah Stain, who doesn't seem to have much physical prowess. I think that has been the norm, but it is changing. Jessica Jones and Trish Walker (soon to be Hellcat) have started to change the narrative.

Same.  New one coming out soon. Come back!  I don't think we're done!  I was surprised Sir Patrick was the bad guy and it wasn't Ludendorf.
Is it the Avengers? I love Marvel Comics! Yes it is, the 2012 Avengers made by Marvel Comics. I'd definitely watch that again. Who's your favorite character? It's Nick Fury, the director of S.H.I.E.L.D I  love how he manages to assemble the superheroes and defeat the villain. Unique choice! I think my favorite is Iron Man. I love Tony Stark's bad boy attitude and Robert Downey is awesome. I agree Do you generally watch movies based on ratings? Sometimes I do - it depends. I go to Rotten Tomatoes a lot, but if I've already made up my mind to see a movie, I just do. Like if it's a Stars Wars movie, I will always see it, no matter what the critics say. This movie has 92% on Rotten Tomatoes and a metacritic score of 69/100. Do you agree with these scores? I definitely do. It's very well made, and that Metacritic score is pretty good considering MC scores are usually skewed lower. One of the key scenes in the movie is when Loki shows his desire for destruction by making a deal with the Chitauri. Agreed. I like Loki as a character; he's three-dimensional, not just a cookie-cutter villain. I'm also happy with how they've developed Thor. This deal is made on the promise that he will give them the Tesseract, one of the most poweful energy sources. Not as powerful as the Infinity Gauntlet, though! That's going to be killer in this next film. I also liked the scene when the Avengers become divided of their different opinions on how to deal with the imminent threat. That's the coolest part about the team - they're all human, and they all butt heads, just like humans do. It makes them relatable and down to earth. I think it gives the the opportunity to show their acting skills. Do you agree? Definitely do. I also think it gives each actor a chance to really dig down into their character's motivations. When you watch the movie, note that Loki character is build in a way in which for him, simply defeating the Avengers will never be enough.

That problem causes her to quit her job. What a shame That was too bad, she wasn't the best at handling the media like a politician. It is also natural for there to be tension between predators and prey though. Yes but you have to handle that too, just like different kinds of humans in the real world.  The savagery of the predators was caused by "night howlers" which were a flower. Which were a type of flower/ It's comparable to the real world where drugs alter people's behavior and cause problems. Yes, but Bellwether the deputy mayor was having predators shot with a serum from the flowers in order to destabilize everything and become Mayor. That's wrong on many levels. Judy should have been the mayor because you could see that she had good intentions.
Then this doctor implanted this device into his chest. He became Iron Man. Oh! I did see this one! The implant keeps him alive. ANd he designs and Iron Man suit to escape. Exactly!

Yeah that was very touching for me too but i always like movies with happy endings. Me too! Do you usually watch movies with good ratings or do you also watch movies with bad ratings at times? both but i prefer good ratings. Yeah I agree...

Definitely! About how long does the movie last? IT got great reviews too. 92% on Rotten Tomatoes I'm not sure how long the movie is. The plot seems a little complex though so it probably isn't short It also has some allusions to Greek Mythology (Zeus) I'll have to check the critics then, I always like to check comments before viewing a movie Me too. Metacritic has it at 76/100 and CinemaScore is A I love a movie with greek mythology Are there any other well known actors that play in it Chris Pine is the male protaganist. He is the American solider rescued by Wonder Woman in the beginning And Robin Wright plays Antiope, another Greek mythology character So it seems to be a lot of women in this one. i think that would make for a great spin off to show the strong women super heroes
ood afternoon , how are you ? its sunny here in pittsburgh , so i am taking a walk . how about you ? , my back hurts , like it pretty much always does , so i could be better i am sorry . what are you doing for your back to help yourself ? y quack doctors suggesting acupuncture , but that cannot be anything but a money grab
it s fun 2016 movie with ben affleck and henry cavill oh cool “153 minutes of a grown man whacking two dolls together, has the definition of 'movie'changed from 'motion picture story that a human wrote on purpose' to '700 onlytangentially related 12-second grey and red vignettes’?” haha that is funny sure makes you want to watch it eh? lol what else? "The point of Batman v Superman isn't fun, and it isn't thinking, either. It's obedience. Thetheology is invoked ... to buttress a spectacle of power. And in that way the film serves asa metaphor for its own aspirations. The corporations that produce movies like this one, andthe ambitious hacks who sign up to make them, have no evident motive beyond their ownaggrandizement." wow deep lol Jesse Eisenberg is lex luthor oh cool i kinda like him haha yes "As the film progresses, Lex degenerates into a gibbering mad man, some strange mix ofthe Riddler and the Joker with a little bit of Mark Zuckerberg added for flair." haha harsh keep then comin
hat is not too far from here . do you have any hobbies ? i barely have time for hobbies since i am a nurse . rses have demanding schedules . wall street is just a 9 5 . wall street sounds exciting , my husband the fireman loves excitement it can be . at least i enjoy wearing suits and ties . i only get dressed up for my favorite sushi restaurant sushi is delicious , but i stay home to eat with my poodle nanette . my kids love dogs . do you have kids ?
Ben Affleck was Batman and Henry Cavill was Superman ahh I usually enjoy affleck movies. Just never been into superman or batman really I generally like super hero movies but this one was terrible. I don't recommend it. It only got 27% on Rotten Tomatoes. oh wow! my husband likes marvel movies but we might have to skip this one how long is it? 153 minutes of boredom yep no thank you lol It's a shame because the last DC Comics movie Wonder Woman was so good. i usually prefer comedies or romance. do they get into much romance with clark kent and lois lane? Oh my husband loved wonder woman, i never got into it Amy Adams played Lois Lane but her character wasn't central to the plot. oh okay. I do like amy adams how old is the movie? isnt it newer? Yeah she's a good actor. The worst part was probably the bad guy Lex Luthor. It came out in 2016 so pretty new. Is there much humor? More action? There isn't really any humor. It's mostly action scenes. The climax is a huge fight scene between Batman and Superman. Who wins? ;-) It's frustrating and unpleasant to watch two good guys fight each other. Well it seemed like Batman was winning. He almost killed Superman. Yeah I couldn't imagine either of the losing really Personally, I think Superman should have won because he's the one with the real superpowers. Batman just has money and technology. Yeah I guess I'd agree with that! Thanks for your suggestion, I think I will stay away from that movie Haha no problem. Thanks for listening to my complaints. My husband can rent it if he's really interested :-P Maybe he'll enjoy it if he keeps his expectations low.
yes coo , i will be out front
hey hate that stuff but maybe i could like it
llo how are you today ? i am good . listening to some smooth jazz . hat is absolutely great just fantastic what do you do for a living ? i make hot dogs for a living . oh cool . i am a stock broker on wall street .
Tom Hanks is plays Woody, the protagonist. Tim Allen is Buzz Lightyear, the second protagonist Oh, I totally love Tom Hanks and I think I've heard of Tim Allen as well. So, what's the movie about The movie is a kids' movie, but it was the first feature-length movie made entirely by computer animation. It's basically about these toys that come to life I understand...I now remember some parts of other Toy Story movies. The animations were awesome. Can you please tell me a bit more related to the plot? What are Woody and Buzz trying to do? Their owners (Andy and his family) are moving to a hew ouse and they somehow get left behind during the move, so Buzz and Woody (plus a few other toys) make this crazy journey to Andy's new house. Hmm, that seems really interesting What else?

Me too! That is one of the best scenes for sure. I also like the part where Quint shows up! I can't believe Quint offered his services for $10000. That was a lot of money back then. Yes! Of course, the mayor did not want them to close the beaches... Good thing oceanographer Matt Hooper was there to confirm the death was a shark attack. That was deifnitely a lot for back then. Yes, Hooper was like the expert?! Yeah. Remember when the local fisherman tried to catch a large tiger shark? I can't believe they declared the beach safe. Even after Hooper disputed that. So, they thought a tiger shark did that?
i don't either i think it takes away from liking it just because you like it. this is animation movie do you enjoy them? I do not like animation movies. What is the movie called Zootopia it a movie about a rabbit and inclusive Okay, have you seen it? yes i have with the kids. it is about a bunny how does fit as a typical police officer but she doesn't give up who* Sounds like a good family movie. yea it's goal was to address stereotypes it was a good comedy with a message That sounds good. I like comedies me to. comedy is a great stress reliever.  this movie  was wonderful for the kids Awesome, I think I will see it that's cool i think i am suppose to go over the new information i got from zootopia were you giving a page to go over information? stuff like how the kind animals turn in rabid animals I don't have any info ah okay well do you have any question about the movie. it was also about anti bullying How was it anti-bullying? there was fox in the movie who was bullied because he wasnt  good enough and he helped the bunny officer realize that you can't assume  that a fox or any animal is just one thing Oh, that's a good message for kids. at first the fox is seen as sneaky and undermined but after a time the bunny realized that circumstance help foster bad behavior

Iron Man for sure Yeah he was mine too. I liked Robert Downey Jr's potrayal of him Who was your least favorite? Probably Black Widow I thought she was kind of boring too. I'm not a big Scarlett Johansson fan no chemistry with the other characters I liked Thor too He was pretty cool I don't think she is as great as everyone makes her to be. Who directed the movie? Thor was pretty bland in the first movie. Joss Sweden right? Ah, I think it's Joss Whedon I can't remember the plot line what happened exactly in the movie? Its where Loki tries to take over. Who was Loki? Thors brother. Ah okay Who was their father? It has the big fight with the worm hole and iron man almost gets stuck in space.

Oh, not me, anything with Benedict Cumberbatch is not boring. I'm not into history, which probably explains why I didn't appreciate this film. Have you read the book? The information in the document says that 91% of critics liked it, which is usually a good sign, I can't see where the percentage of regular people is listed. No, haven't read the book. That's a good point.  I might have to give it another shot.  Usually I disagree with critics though. I don't normally read too many biographies, I guess I feel about them like you do about history. I thought the subject matter was very important, though, how he was treated by the general publiceven though he was basically winning the war for them. Definitely.  If I had to choose between a history book and a history movie I'd definitely choose the movie. It says in the information, though, that a lot of that conflict was injected into the movie and that it didn't really exist I feel like movies exaggerate everything. It's sad that he was bullied in school and even sadder that his love interest died before he could ever tell him that he was in love with him.

I agree -- Downey was made for the role of Tony Stark/Iron Man. He started the game! Marvel is killing it especially this year! What did you think of the opening sequence of the movie?  In particular, what did you think about Tony Stark's capture by the Ten Rings terrorist group? That was an excellent scene! How he began to build his suit I agree.  I think Tony Stark's ingenuity was amazing, giving the limited resources available to him.  Additionally, I thought the action leading up to his capture and imprisonment by the Ten Rings was intense. given* I loved his development. He was cocky man with not much consideration for other until that event. Not the most typical superhero origin story Precisely.  I did find a sense of irony in the fact that Stark was injured by one of his own missiles. Exactly! The story telling is top notch. This one is definitely my top 5 of the marvel films Definitely my top 5 of marvel films What was your reaction to discovering Obadiah was behind Stark's capture and imprisonment by the Ten Rings? To be honest I wasn’t the most surprised but it was still a good scene You weren't surprised that Stane betrayed Stark?  Why is that? I guess the character didn’t impact me as much throughout The film so when the betrayal happen I wasn’t all too shocked What do you mean?  And how does that relate to my previous question? What did you think about the final fight scene between Stark and Stane? That was my answer What do you mean? But I love the fight scene though The fight scene was intense.  In regards to my previous question, what I meant to ask was, how did you arrive to the conclusion that Stane betrayed Stark because his [Stane's] character did not impact you? In other words, I don't understand the logic.
He must have been pretty good if he was able to fake being a doctor and a pilot! What was he doing when your mother got to meet him? He was doing a seminar about how he is now helping the FBI to make it harder to do what he did.  (faking all the documents).  Thanks to him, we now have better watermarks and technology. If you can't beat them, join them. I guess that's what the FBI did. Must be a cool story. Did you see it in the theater?
d i had my eyebrow pierced for him . yes , in college .
Does the movie have a happy ending? and sheriff woody organizes the toys, i would say it does buzz impresses the other toys and andy begins to favor him Do the toys have any interaction with humans? woody accidently knocked buzz out the window because of jealousy no they are lifeless when he is around
Left me to assume that one of them had a great job. A Christmas vacation in Paris with all the kids except one. Marley was a good neighbor Kevin soon found out while being home alone. Kevin tried to get them to think his parents and family were at home but the burglars knew he was home alone on Christmas eve
ll . what type of work do you do and where ? h , i hate my job its not important . but i love to drink ice cold tea ! very job is important . you like jokes huh ? what do call a camel with 3 humps ? i disagree . my mom agrees me . do not know , what ? you disagree with what ? you live with your mom ?

It sounds like a very interesting movie, I really like that they used anthropomorphic animals. Yes! The anthropomorphic animals were very interesting. The movement and quality of the movie was fabulous.
my trust fund pays the bills , so i have more time for manicures hat must be such a fun life to live ! any kids ? married ?
i am sick of pizza . i am sick of food . i want to try new things .
I can't think of another one he's in. I think the humor is more situational in this movie, more that they're living at an extreme The scene talked about is a typical hollywood depiction that can be made to be funny I think the cast is good enough to make it good no matte the subject matter Yeah it's a solid cast. A lot of experienced actors, and some up and comers Im not a Jonah Hill fan but this part suited him I like him a role like this, but he's not often cast this way For a comedy it has an intricate storyline Yeah it's very story driven. Less reliant on jokes The crooks this is based on should be jail, not writing books about it I think some of them did go to jail, but i agree This seems like a Scorsese film , both in tone and story Seems like their rise happens quite quickly. Penny stocks to 22million in an hour. Yeah they were good at what they did
oh , where did you go to school ? pstate , where i grew up . you ?
i am well , what are you up to ? just watching casablanca with my kids . i am watching chucky with my fiancé . how many kids do you have ?
oh , that sounds dirty . i am always getting sick . i am told i am a hypochondriac . he opposite actually , developing a new grease solvent hat sounds quite interesting . have you had dinner ? i had a protein shake when i got home . what did you have ? i had some tofu . i follow a strict vegan diet . oh interesting , is that because of your faith ? somewhat , but i just want to keep healthy so i do not get sick .
cool ! i do not have any pets , do you ? yes , i have two cats and 4 dogs
i agree . i do not like football much either . so are you aggressive at all ? i have been known as a gentle giant lol o not really . having a daughter i had to shy away from that side of myself . well that is always good . you just have one ? yes , my only child so i am quite protective of her . do you have kids ? o i do not have any kids . i drive to fast to have kids yet haha what kind of cars do you enjoy driving ? well i own a 92 mustang fastback . i have almost died twice in it
i will bet . i was never good at math . oh hells no , i am terrible what kind of math class are you taking ? just basic intro math . flunked the tests to get passed it hat is no fun . i am better working in a garage .
i thought it was very funny too... it wasn't just a movie for the kids. It was great for adults as well! Steve Carell played his character very well. It seemed like even though it was a cartoon it was still relatable Definitely, this is a movie I actually look forward to watching when my kids ask. I wish there were more out there like this that the whole family can enjoy. I dont mind watching despicable me with my kids at all. I still laugh at it even after seeing it at least a dozen times Us too, and I just noticed Russell Brand is Dr. Nefario, I never knew that! me either. im surprised i didnt know before now. I love russell brand The Pharrell song was also a huge part of the movie, it went with it so well. That is so true. Do you agree with the ratings the movie was given? I dont understand the whole Rotten Tomato scoring system, but I see an "A" and I know that has to be good, so I would agree.
Well it just seems like the dark side of life and that's not what I am about. I like upbeat, realistic type of movies. If this movie was more upbeat but still rather unrealistic, do you think you'd have a better response to it? Probably, but with the feedback from you and what I've read I probably would venture to see it just based on the characters as well. The first key scene does sound pretty dark, but at least it provides a lot of background as to why the movie becomes dark. When I am in the mood I do like to envision how life would have been like in the days of kingdoms and such. Do you believe that life could have happened that way with the Moors civilization? I think that real life could have been similar in a lot of ways, without the fairies and such, of course. Do you think that Maleficent still loved Stefan despite his betrayal?
very cool ! what else do you like to do in your free time ? play football and watch movies . i love star wars . i love football too ! go packers !
re you in school still ?

It sure has! It had potential with the main character going from a small fish in a big pond to a big fish in a small pond early in his career, but I guess the movie took a turn after that. Greed is not always fun to watch I guess! It can come off as kind of one note.
what kind of food do you guys eat
it seems some of the critics were taking a jab at it, with their comments on how Pixar is "inspiring the midlist" Sometimes critics can be blinded, I wish they would try to understand more first what do you mean? do you feel the critics reviewed the movie unfairly? Understand that this is a flip on normal movies, usually villians take over but they did the opposite, they had the villian be the star from the description it doesn't sound like the villian follows a different story trajectory than most heroes in other movies he has a mission. he has a challenge to overcome, he has a rival. the only thing is he is on the "bad guy's" side from the beginning That is true as well. All in all it was an animation I can enjoy, animation is one of my favorite generes I think one of the more interesting parts was when the pyramid of giza got stolen that was the part that set it all off, no?

Hi I absolutely agree I love the whole Iron Man franchise Isn't Robert Downey, Jr. the greatest? Yes he for sure is a great actor love pretty much all of his movies Gwyneth Paltrow was pretty good, too. yeah she's decent I like all of these Marvel superhero movies The critics' ratings were fair. yeah i'm suprised usually rotten tomato's is not very kind Don't know why Metacritic only gave it 79/100, they must be mad at Downey about something! yeah probably didn't like his father or something his dad wasn't that good of an actor I love the part where he's laying on the table in the terrorist's cave. in his tin can suit that he makes with scrap metal hopefully they keep making more Iron Mans Raza was evil, they did a pretty good job showing how terrorists treat their prisoners, don't you think? Yes I do think they did a fine job with that It was kind of a giveaway, he couldn't die that early in the movie. right they never kill off the good guy in the beginning of a movie I think that Tarrence Howard did well playing Rhodes in the movie too That was pretty awesome when the F-22's were firing at him. yeah I enjoyed that scene a lot I feel this is one movie that probably won't ever need a reboot They can make as many as they want and I will still keep watching them. yes same here I even look forward to seeing him in the new infinity war movies coming out

Hmm. You think so? I just feel like all the actors were great but they could have done a better job portraying significant scenes. Ohh yeah, I am having a bit of trouble remembering any scenes actually, but that is right, actors were great. Lol, I remember this movie being dark, theme wise, most of the parts that I can remember are so dark like it happened in the night. Gloomy right, I think they did that on purpose to set the mood for the feelings for Maleficent. Hmm, I agree. I can't believe the low rating for the movie still, it should deserve at least 70 percent right? Maybe a 6/10, like I said, I enjoyed the movie, but some scenes are not that popping out or significant that it falls flat. Yeah, the actor who plays Stefan is a good actor by the way. Right? I remember him being in other movies.
haha , i like what you did there . do you like hiking too , or just cycling ?
you do . i guess i do as well . i am heading to india next week
very cool i make a living playing in a band what kind of music ? i like rock . some rock mainly country . how often do you fly ? i fly four times a week . i live in salt lake city .
I think Jesse Eisenberg did a really great job playing Mark Zuckerberg yes he did and if you see he some what adapted the whole character of Mark, from walking to talking style Yeah! He's a great actor And Andrew Garfield as well yes when the whole lawsuit and hearing was going on i loved that scenes Justin Timberlake surprised me in this movie. He's not the best actor but he played Sean Parker really well haha me too! I didnt knew facemash is the first start by Mark that was pretty mean actually Yes it was But the idea of implementing it is what i liked and probably that triggered him to make Facebook oh yeah definitely, he wanted to feel powerful I liked the entry scene of Sean, means Justin and he also stole the original idea somewhat from those Winklevoss twins hahaha yes he did oh at that restaurant/bar? and they all ordered martinis haha yes kind og of* Who was Albright again? The gf that dumped her at start ooh yeah ok I forgot that he sent her a request Erica is the name I guess I think i dont remember that scene i guess maybe missed it
No. What is it about? Hello? It's a cartoon movie.  It's about a bunny from a rural town and her dream is to become a police officer in the metropolis of zootopia That sounds great! It's quite funny and great for kids and parents a like.  I really enjoyed it. So, you already watched it? Jason Bateman plays the fox, he's quite funny as well. Yes, I've seen it. I don't know who is he lol You've probably seen him in TV shows but just don't know his name.  Been in a ton of stuff from Arrested Development to other movies and TV shows. Oh, I see. Is the movie available in Netflix? Anyways, in the movie there is a scene where the bunny and the fox are working together in zootopia where all these different types of animals live, and they are trying to find out why some animals are going rabid and crazy on one another. I believe it was on Netflix at one time.  Not sure if it still is. Just checked, it is on Netflix yes. I believe it won an academy award if I'm not mistaken too. I don't want to give too much away but the main theme is the predator animals(tigers) vs the hunted animals (rabbits) and someone manipulating them all in zootopia to get what they want.  Don't want to spoil it though. Hello?  You there? Yes, Sorry about that I went outside to pee LOL I will watch it Ok I will speak with my kids about the movie Hope there is some kind of moral in there Thanks for suggesting
Did you like the movie? It was ok. But not the best Batman movie Did you know that the movie was made in 2016? Yup! Did you realize this was Wonder Woman's first appearance in a DC Comics movie? I like the Man of Steel, what did you think about the movie "The Man of Steel"? I'm not sure about that...but Do you usually like super hero movies? Yes, I did realize that was the first Wonder Woman first St appearance in a comic movie. Yes, I do. I usually don't watch many super hero movies, but I kind of like that Superman is the "bad guy" in this film I didn't realize Superman was the bad guy in that movie. Batman seems to think he was! I used to see Superman play the good guy. Yes, you are right. I never really care for Batman, I think he is one of the weak hero. this Batman is definitely not as good as Christopher nolan's version! Do you think Luthor is a fun "bad guy?" Yes, I do. i like his roll in Batman Movies. And Jesse Eisenberg plays him well. Although I thought he was a little bit over the top at times. Do you agree? Yes, I do agree with you. Do you like these new comic movies, especially the graphics? I'm not really into comic movies. But some of the graphics can be pretty impressive. They definitly have a lot of action! Do you think Batman had major guilt about what he did to Superman? Do you like the new Superman, Henry Cavil? I think Henry Cavil does a good job...he's good at playing the "duel personality" that Superman is about. Nerd vs. Sexy Hero I don't think Batman had little guilt about what he did. Yes, I agree, he played his part well. So why do you think he gave his regrets to Superman's Mom? To make himself feel better? or just because he felt like he should? To make himself feel better. I agree. Do you feel like this movie is better than the 27% that Rotten Tomatoes has rated it? Do you remember Superman mom's name?

y biggest fear is they will reject me do not fear rejection . keep you chin up and go to paris .
The screenplay was highly praised by critics in the Rolling Stone calling it "comic gold" However, it is definitely geared towards teenagers Just because it's geared towards teenagers, doesn't necessarily mean it's bad. BBC's "skins" was geared toward teens but it's brilliant. It can't be terrible if Rolling Stone praised it, however. Do you like teen comedies? Not normally, but sometimes. Clueless was good, and DUFF, but there are still a bunch that are really terrible. I'd say they're good about 35-40% of the time. When you watch the movie, note Lindsey's Lohan's character was actually homeschooled for sixteen years in Africa, before settling down in Evanston, Illinois where she attends public school for the first time
i just graduated with a ba in education . i am 22 , right on schedule . ood to here that , i have 13 they is a hand full right . i know almost all the students already . the job is in my hometown . ok my is in my home town also hmm . are we siamese twins ? do you adore the children , too ? yes , i love drinking coffee what about you i got a coffee maker after i moved into a nearby apartment . i buy a box of chocolate every two week what about you o . i like children so much that i would share to much of it with them !

And since Bruce Waynes late mother is also Martha, that was a good plot device. Agreed. It bought Superman enough time for Lane to arrive and explain everything to save his life! I'm glad Batman was  able to rescue Martha! And while Batman rescues Martha, superman confronted Lex Luthor on the Scout Ship. That was a great scene! Luther being confronted by the man he was obsessed with defeating!

Yes, Jaws was great. I think I'll watch it again this weekend. I really enjoyed Roy Scheider in the movie. Yes, the acting is what made the movie for me I think, that and the screenplay. Did you agree with the mayors decision to reopen the beaches No, putting the public at risk for more tourism dollars sounds as dangerous as it is immoral. I agree. You could also argue that putting a bounty on the shark is also immoral. It is just Hollywood though lol Yes, and a 40+ year old film. Good stuff to think about though. Especially the unlikeliness that there would be more than one shark Definitely a great screenplay though It did a great job guiding the audience through the story in a very blunt, jarring way, which is just what a thriller needs IMO. Keep the audience on their toes. It also made me feel like the characters like Michael were realistic and they could be someone I knew Yes, the characters were all too human, with little grandstanding or histrionics. Clearly we weren't the only ones who liked it. It has a 97% on rotten Tomatoes which must be pretty good Yes, it's a pretty highly-regarded movie; has been since 1975. I imagine it will be just as well-regarded in another 40 years. I do find the naming of the boat, Orca as quite ironic. Must be a pretty big boat A "killer whale" hunting a killer shark; too bad the boat didn't have teeth....
i play field hockey and soccer , so sometimes one comes with me not the biter
cool , that is nice i like that i love it . do you like to bake ? i just made brownies .
I do like Benedict Cumberbatch the most- because of Doctor Strange Don't care for the other actors Do you think the movie have a good rating? Yes, based on the ratings it should be good and interesting It seems all the scores are high which I do base some of my movie watch off of. Do movie reviews matter to you? I don't really care about what critics say about movies because i noticed sometimes they say bad things about great movies and great things about bad movies
Spoiler alert - Kirill dies! No more problems from Kirill! Perkin later frees herself and kills Harry which is against the rules and she gets called into a meeting at the htoel and is executed for breaking the Continental's rules.

Me, too. Yes, the music was great. I liked the humor throughout as well
What else
Oh, I remember. Some of those scenes are memorable for sure. Yes it seems everyone is in disbelief that Jaws actually was real. Richard Dreyfuss is still acting, right? Always liked him. I think Roy Schneider passed on though.

well it was nice talking to you , have a good  day!
yeah great scene! It is about Bruce who works as a news reporter but is wanting to become something bigger in his employment. He then becomes very powerful to teach a life lesson as the role of God I like the idea of it, but it almost seems like it could be a sort of dark movie instead of a light hearted comedy it isn't at all. Do you think it could have been made that way? no I don't think the movie could have been made dark. the comedy in it was a perfect fit for the script. Like, imagine if Groundhog Day (if you've seen it) was made but wasn't a laughy comedy well, imagine what someone could/would do if they've been given Godly powers, I think it's an interesting idea I am sure some people would try and use it for evil. But in a sense it teaches you to be grateful for everything if used properly who else is in the movie?
i am not sure what that is . what is it ? live action role play ? kind of like medieval times acting o i have never done it . is it fun ? yes ! super fun i love game of thrones so i act it out !

the director Tom Shadyac must be a religious man I think he is definitely not religious putting Morgan Freeman as a God or humanize the God, is not religious at all yes..the dam was collapsing thats why Jim had to build an arc to save all the animals and the people but they didnt understand ohhh, now I remember oh ...yes, true that although the movie is not religious, it gave a lot messages how people should act whether they are not religious or not that is not expected in a comedy movie I realized I do not remember some scenes very well, maybe it a reason to re-watch the movie again aaaaanddd you are gone again oh shit im here buddy no need to rewatch I think there are other very good Jim cary Movies out there im here now buddys yeah, what was the name of the movie that he plays as a TV guy but he does not know it yeah, Truman Show I love that also i forgot but i have seen that one..its so funny anyway, I think it was good to chat chat ended..nice talking with u cheers

Tell me some reasons why u hate that movie....
It doesn't sound like an interesting movie so far. Is there any other information I should know? The film was actually based on a short story called "Steel" in 1956 Can you tell me more about this story? It was later adapted into the twilight zone in 1963 Sure. Is the 1963 Twilight zone version worth watching? In the year 2020. Human boxers are replaced by robots I'm not sure about the twilight zone one. What's the plot hook? Or what would hypothetically make me interested in watching htis? A former boxer (hugh jackman) Charlie owns one of these robots. He loses it in one fight. The robot? Yes. It turns out that the fight was rigged so he would lose. At this point I'm fairly confident that I won't be watching this movie. I trust your evaluation.

Pixar animated studios for Walt Disney
It does: but, it's appropriate.  One of the central conflicts in the film revolves around Gru's perception of himself.  As the "super villian", he sees himself as a "despicable" person. However, during the course of the movie, you see that he actually has a very big heart He ends up adopting three girls and learns to parent creatively and ends up choosing "his girls" over the chance to be the bigger villain on earth. Is it an animation? Yes!  And, a well crafted one, at that.  It was produced by Universal.   It's obviously digitally animated.  More along the lines of Pixar movies.  And, the soundtrack is amazing. Interesting. is it kid friendly? Very much so!  But, as a bonus, there are some clever inside jokes that play to parents and grandparents.  It's definitely appropriate for a family movie night.   The overall theme is the importance of family and teaamwork. Steve Carrel does some amazing voice work, as the main character. Ah that sounds good...though I wouldn't mind seeing this plot with Catwoman in the lead What tunes are in the soundtrack that u mentioned. I'm not sure Cat Woman would fit well, in this case.  Really, It pokes fun at the concept of super villains and the  stereotypical "crimes" they often pursue.   Gru, in this movie, wants to steal the moon...but is foiled by another up-and-coming super villain.  In the end, he ends up giving the moon to his girls...which is  a cute stereotype of a good father. Pharrel wrote the main theme song and performs it: the lyrics are peppy and comical.  There are other contemporary and classical pieces that help weave the narrative together. wow...that really sounds original. never seen anything like that It is an original concept, for sure.  If you tend towards an appreciation for silly humor, the minions have  you covered. They often get themselves into very Rube-Goldberg-esque shennanigans.
I'm not sure how long it is but it had a CinemaScore of A any negative feedback ? No but I'll tell you about some key scenes It starts in Vietnam in 1996 and follows State Department military analyst Daniel Ellsberg He grows disillusioned with the war so he starts taking secret photocopies of classified Vietnam reports then leaks them to the New York Times! ok, it seems interesting Not so different from real life today :-) Yes extremely interesting No wonder one critic said "Spielberg makes these crucial days in American history easy to follow" It seems a great movie, what is the main point of the plot ? It's a political thriller You're basically watching what happens when the people on the inside get fed up And take their case directly to the people on the outside aka the American Public! So there is as much action in the Pentagon as in the offices of the Post ? I'm not sure, the key scenes of the movie focuson the Post Lots of drama there e.g. they're worried the Nixon administration could bring CRIMINAL chrges against them! OK, so it is a little like Spotlight ?
yes I like them too what was your favorite part of the movie? I definitely like his Costume that he flies around in, pretty cool technology... yeah. i liked the special effects I have to watch the entire movie some time to understand what is going on since I'm not a big comic fan and don't know much about it yeah i'm not a fan of comics either but i do like the super hero movies I like Thor but I think they make too many super hero movies nowadays they are making all of them lol with iron man i never understood why he had to have that thing in his chest Yes, and most of them are apocalyptic, doom , boom and gloom!:-) why couldn't they just take out the shrapnel out of his chest You would think, right, with all the technology they had!:-) some things are harder to believe yes, so some of it becomes too unrealistic and corny! i mean i know its a comic i guess true movies more lol I think they are making all these comics movies to pry the kids away from their game consoles! i like true movies more i mean ah maybe and definitely to make money ha But not exceeding, the new generation is addicted! yeah that's why almost no one goes to the movies anymore! and there are all of these spin offs like the SHIELD tv show and stuff yeap, from the old days, can't even keep up with them all! LOVE shield! I watch that religiously! The story just keeps getting more ingteresting after all these years! is there a comic just about sheild?

I am assuming as in "dark".  I often disagree with critcs about movies so I am not discouraged. Yeah, I think so too.  I also generally disagree with the critics too. I see it has Leonardo DiCaprio also. Yes, it does. I generally like movies with him in it. Yes DiCaprio and McConaughey. You can't go wrong. I don't think so either! It sounds intense.  I really need to see this movie. They portray such a wild culture of the people "of Wall Street". I wonder if it is really like that. I know I mentioned earlier that I think it is, but I don't know. I sometimes feel like things are greatly exaggerated in movies. Yeah, you really should!

So which movie is it? Can you tell me the title? I am very sorry. Lol, I misread the title. The movie is Iron Man. I meant superhero movie haha. Sweet! Who is in it? What is it about? Can you tell me a bit about the movie? Iron Man is about Tony Stark, CEO of Stark Industries, a weapons manufacturer. Pretty cool! Who plays Tony Stark? Basically Iron Man is a billionaire with an armored suit to fight injustice in the world lol. Tony Stark is played by Robert Downey Jr. You havent watched it yet? You don't know Iron Man? :O Sounds great! So tell me more about the movie. The armored suit is great and all. And what happens? So when Tony Stark was showing his tech somewhere like in a deserted country, when he was about to get home he got kidnapped by terrorists... When he was held captive. He got help from a guy named Yinsen to build the very first armored suit. He used it to escape and kill the bad peeps. Jeez. Terrorists kidnap the CEO of weapons manufacturers Okay now he escapes and then what? Scary stuff huh? When he got back, he wanted to end being a weapons manufacturing company and use his tech to good use. Still he made a better armored suit though haha. Quite smart he built an armoured suit in the desert. He must be very intelligent He sure is, he's a genius, billionaire, playboy philanthropist kind of dude.

I have heard a little about it . I never knew that was the original name. Prepare yourself for what I'm about to tell you - because not only is Frozen Disney's 53rd animated feature film. but it is also a musical. I feel that telling you details of the plot would do the film injustice. Frozen is a film that needs to be experienced. I think it would be a really good family film. I have a daughter that would like it I am not to sure about my son. family or no family, this film will be life changing Your daughter will lose her mind as she is introduced to Elsa, a 21yr old princess who has magic snow powers. sounds like a good time. What was your favorite part? All the parts were my favorites. from beginning to end this movie takes you on an adventure into the snow-capped mountains of arendelle I can really picture myself there. reindeer, witty snowman, a giant ice castle, love, it's all there

The cast consisted of Tom Hanks and Tim Allen as the lead roles Sounds familiar.  I don't thing I saw it.  Was it a comedy? It has some funny moments but its a movie for younger children made by disney What was the name of the moview? Toy Story Wow - Woody and co. huh? yeah its a great time Yeah I saw it way back when .  What was the little girls name? I honestly cant remember, are you referring to the sister? That's okay.  What was the name of the space guy - you know - TO INFINITY AND BEYOND!! Buzz Lightyear HAHAHA.  It's starting to come back now. Is that the one were Woody was given away? yeah he has to get out of a lot of trouble Hmmmm didn't he get run over in that film or almost run over? they almost do, but they hang on to the back of the garbage truck It's like numbing my mind to remeber some of the other characters.  Did they go into  a toy store in that movie? no that was the second one Oh yeah.  The first one was when the boy lost him or left him behind? yeah andy left him

ink stains ? what do you have ink stains from ? my pens like to explode oh , that is not good . i use pens when i write poetry . poetry is cool . i wrote a poem about training a real dragon
Does this seem like a movie that you would enjoy watching or do the rotten tomato scores scare you off? Hello. I think the Rotten Tomatoes score for this film seems fine and I like the review. Do you like the SuperHero genre? Generally I think the SuperHero genre is interesting. I don't like movies though that have both super heroes and real people so I'm not sure if I would like this or not Do you like super hero origin stories? I see. Sure I agree with you on that. This one seems interesting in that it has an origin story. I find superhero films with an origin story in it Yes I see that as well A great ensemble of actors/actresses. Gary Oldman, Christian Bale, etc. It is interesting the Japanese actor Ken Watanabe is in it. I wonder how critical a role he plays in this one. Yes, I like most of the performers that I know. There are many that are highly acclaimed. I'm not sure who Watanabe is. I don' think his inclusion is something that would motivate me to or not to see the movie since I don't recognize his name. Well okay. But in the cast section it says Liam Neeson is Henri Ducard / Ra's al Ghul. I wonder what that is supposed to mean. He is supposed to play two roles or something that could be interesting Do you think that's the alter ego character? Are you a big fan of Chris Nolan's films? I think he is a great director and I have no doubt this is an excellent film similar to Bruce Wayne and batman? I think that Nolan is an excellent director I have no clue but I think you are onto something! Ahhh! Here Bruce meets Henri Ducard while he travels around the world There is some new information here about his background... I find that interesting That obviously means they are not the same person Yes. Indeed. It says "a swarm of bats." I wonder how they managed to film "a swarm of bats" yeah I have no idea about that - do you think they were CGI
quite . i want to travel . mostly road trips right now with the kiddos . hat is good . i wish i could say that about myself . . . i feel stuck in life . oh no ! tell me more ? well , i have lost my job . . . cannot afford my own place . . . oh , i am so sorry to hear about that . do you have any hobbies to uplift you ? yes , i like reading . it helps , but then i feel like i waste time doing it . but pursuing things that make you happy is never a waste of time .
Who is the enemy in the movie? ILOKI LOKI Ah I see! Thor's brother. Have you seen the first two films? HE IS THE LEADER OF AN CHITAURI When will the movie be released?
Major Larry was such a jerk. I will have to try them. I will never understand the boat they took Orca to hunt the shark.  It never seemed adequate. You should absolutely watch Jaws 2, but Jaws 3 made me root for the sharks. And I will never understand why Hopper went into that shark cage.

I really enjoyed this movie.... I think Spielberg does an excellent job in his more serious films. And I love Tom Hanks as the lead actor... how did you feel about the film? I also liked the movie as well, meryl streep is a really good actress How do you feel about Katherine Graham and her being the first female publisher for a major newspaper? I think it was a good subject for the film, and I agree with you that Streep captured the role very well. It's always difficult to balance historical accuracy and an entertaining plot, but I think the film did that well. It definitely gave me a lot of information about a subject I wasn't too well-versed in I agree with your point as well. It was during the early 1970's so it was definitely controversial. Did you like Bob Odenkirk in the supporting role? I feel like his career has taken off in recent years. \ I did like his supporting role but I feel as if the rotten tomato score should have been better than an 88, do you agree Yeah, though I do know it's very hard to get a very high score on there. Ideally, it would have been higher. But I know some movies that I felt have been very good received significantly lower scores. I'm curious as to how well it did commercially. I as well, the critical responses were good with one person stating "the post passes the trickiest test of historical drama" and i definitely agree I liked the cinematography as well... overall I just thought it was a great film The scene with Ellsberg going along with the troops was also very striking... I thought it set the tone for the movie, and captured a lot of the controversy and uncertainty surrounding the war I as well, I like how the movie revealed classified american documents about the Vietnam War
i really like watching foreign films what is your favorite foreign film ?
Definitely worth it, especially for the minions those are the little yellow creatures

No, I have not, actually. What type of movie is it? It is a fantasy movie. It is really interesting movie. Nice, I like fantasy films. Any famous actors/actresses? The lead role for this movie is Angelina Jolie. Nice to know that you like fantasy movies. Oh nice, she's quite good, I haven't seen her recently. So what's the film about? You can ask me anything you wanna know about this movie. What's the plot? This is about a a powerful fairy living in the forest that seek revenge. because he was cheated by a man because of his ambition. Maleficent used the daughter of the king for her revenge. By the way, the King was the one who cheated her. Seems quite interesting. Is it a drama fantasty, then? Or is it suitable for kids? Maleficent cursed the daughter of the king and the kiss of true love can only remove the curse. Yeah it is really a good movie. Very suitable for children. Okay, great, that would be good for me then. Any favorite scenes you enjoyed or takeaways? What else would you like to know about this movie? Like I said, do you have any favorite scenes or moments from the film? My favorite part is when maleficent kiss Aurora...She did not know that her kiss will remove the curse. What else would you like to know. Oh, so a little surprise, I like that. How was the film rated? Did it get good reviews?

Hi Hello Have you watched this movie? No. But sounds interesting. I like movies based on historical facts. The ratings look good I kinda do too Do you care about ratings? I do. But I might watch a movie with poor ratings if I think it seems interesting. I agree I really love the cast I'm not a big fan of Meryl Streep but i think she is a good actress. I love Tom Hanks I love both of them. Might just see the movie because they are in it. So this movie is about a journalist who attempts to publish the pentagon papers Sounds really interesting I like Steven Spielberg, he makes great movies

Ok, I guess there's not trips during the movie. It involucrates mafia or gang groups? Yep, the mafia, although I'm not entirely sure what involucrate means, but it seems like a fun word! It is! It's like includes. John Wick is kind of a hero? I'd also recommend any films by Tarsem Singh, one of my favorite directors, he has a really unique visual style. Yes, he's the main protagonist of the film. It's probably one of the better action films to come out in the past few years.
ohh nice THIS MOVIE did you like the  director? YES LIKE THAT YOU LIKE THAT YES who is your favorite hero? ARE YOU LOVE THIS MOVIE ya  i loved this movie DO YOU UNDERSTAND THIS MOVIE ya ofcourse

It is a movie aggregate ratings site. Anyways, Bruce Nolan (Jim Carrey) has a complicated life. He is in a relationship with a girl played by Jennifer Aniston yet he has a crush on his co-worker. Yes actually Jim Carrey and Morgan Freeman both have strong personalities so I can picture them both playing God. I think one would be very serious and the other would be a comical God though. haha Oh I really like Jennifer Aniston too. I can't imagine why he would be interested in someone else besides her. Oh yes. My thoughts so too. You know Steve Carell is in the movie. He is sort of Bruce's "rival" Do you mean Stever Carell from The Office? I don't know. This document doesn't say anything about The Office. If so I love him too. He cracks me up. I really enjoy his movies. Oh okay well if it is who I think it is then that is him. Jim Carrey and Steve Carell who be funny rivals against each other I think. This movie is sounding better and better all the time. Well in the movie Bruce is now God and he wants to change his life. He wants to become the anchor at his news station by reporting a miraculous event. Oh I see. Why does he want to change his life?
The plot line of playing "god" for a week is only in this movie. No other ones like it that I am aware of. Ah got it. Is there a sequel to this movie? No current sequel to this film.
you will eventually feel better yes , i certainly hope so it will be just keep praying and stay optimistic

Doesn't he do pranks or something i was not that much naughty but i always wanted to deal with bad guys like he did lol it sounds funny lol cute kid should i watch it again yes yes made it fast , i would suggest start from the first part of it Is it a christmas movie? when he was alone at his home then the new york part of it oh, okay yes in 2nd part he went to new york with his family on Christmas but he missed the flight and got lost in new york Ohh gotcha where he happend to pass by 2 bad guys oh no And they chase him? then rest of the movie revolve around that humors child play yes they chase him fun fun!

I do like Steve Carell, he can be very funny. Sorry that was a typo.  81% 81%? Wow that is great! Carell plays a character name Gru - a mean super villain. Oh, is it a superhero movie? It's an American 3D computer-animated comedy oh wow, I had no idea! What else is it abouot? Gru steals the Great Pyramid of Giza with some help by his Minions. He has a rivalry with another villain named Vector what? That sounds crazy! dang, Vector is an evil name for sure.

is it a long movie It doesn't say, but I'm guessing it would have to be to cover the scope of the material. what is it's rotten tomatoe score 92% and average 8.6/10 does it have an IMDB? Doesn't mention it, just Rotten Tomatoes, Metacritic, and CinemaScore.
Does Gru make the minions do evil things or are they good little minions? The minnions simply make inventions for Gru and assist him in his work. They however are not truly evil and it turns out in the end that neither is Gru. Awww, that sound like a great family film. I don't see very many animated films but I think I'd like to see this one. And I know Steve Carell voices Gru and I like him a lot. Yes! it also has Jason Segel and Russell Brand in it! Which create some great punch lines for a good laugh! That's funny. Russell Brand has such a distinct voice. What character does he voice? It also got an 81% rating on Rotten Tomatoes! which isn't two bad. Russell voices Dr. Nefario who is Gru's elderly gadget man and a friendly scientist in the film! Wow, 81% is a good rating. Dr. Nefario - that's perfect sounding for him. Do the minions talk? The Cinema Score is also an A! That's a high score. It's hard for movies to get an A.
yes do you have a favorite scene? I really like the scene with the Trolls.  The ending also gets me every time when Elsa saves Anna. whats yours the ending is great the scene with the trolls too. I hope the trolls are in the second movie more haha maybe they will have their own spinoff movie that would be cute too

It sounds like it may be interesting. I haven't seen many Sports films, but I feel like most of them tell a meaningful story. This one looks like it has good source material. It looks like it has mixed ratings though It was really interesting that it was based on a true story. Yes, I really enjoy movies based on true stories, so I think I will try this one. I hope you are not disappointed.
y ! what have you been up to this morning ?
Even today, Toy Story has a rating of 100% on Rotten Tomatoes so it has withstood the test of time. Wow, rotten tomatoes is harsh too so that's impressive. I know! Those reviews are brutal.  Did you know that Toy Story was the first feature-length computer animated film? No actually. That's pretty neat. Oddly makes sense? Though I probably would have guessed fantasia if asked. but maybe that's not considered a "film" Though other animated movies are good, and I do enjoy them. They don't really make you think as much as toy story does. Which feels odd to say Toy Story is actually the first feature length film Pixar ever did. Well they did a great job, and still do. I think everyone can relate to the fear of change; just like the toys do while Buzz impresses them with his various features. Revenge, jealously, friendship, and humor are all present.
hat sounds sick . i would love to see it sometime .
o , i am trying to finish college first hat is a good idea . i tend to enjoy being alone . relationships can be frustrating . hey really are , just not worth it hank you so much for the chat , its been nice ! yes , thank you , i agree .

the minions are so cute and funny. I love how they have their different personalities. Eventually, Gru and the girls arrive at Vector's fortress, and Gru steals the shrink ray. I am familiar with the movie, what if he was able to dhrink the moon?

Keanu Reeves is John Wick, who's a hitman who leaves the criminal world and comes back in because his wife is murdered. i dont watch anything less than 5 dayum!..I love Keanu, he never ages My man. It's 6.9. sweeeeet..6.9 is good enough Yeah. The plot's pretty crazy too, apparently. I became keanu reeves fan after watching matrix..and i bet this is going to be as crazy as matrix Someone steals John Wick's car and all the other characters immediately start getting uposet. Whenever he's not in the scene the other characters are like, I can't believe we fucked with John Wick. This was a big mistake. wow crazy all over a car? they said they killed his wife too holy shit! lol im going to level with you i have no idea how to discuss this shit plot lol ok anything goes bro hahaha its just like we are all in for the $2 till the conversation is ended..hahaha john wick goes to the hotel and he kills the guy who fucked with him. then he kills the other guy. the end but it seems to be a nice movie i saw it tbh it's okay all done, goodbye cheers thanks for ur time
so tell me about yourself
same here . get a passport , you will not regret it i will go to spain one day
What did you think of the scene where Elsa accidentally freezes Anna's heart? I thought it was sad but sort of expected it from Elsa's character When did you realize that Hans for bad? Did you expect to see the twist where Hans wanted to take over Arendelle? I realized he was bad when he locked Anna in a room

Yes, also the cast of the film includes Idris Elba, Ginnifer Goodwin Directions stated we talk for 20 min. I am supposed to convince you to watch the film
It seems like Christian Bale received praise for his portrayal of Batman There were good reviews about his portrayal of batman. Although it seems like the movie overall might have been criticized for not giving the characters more depth. i dont know about "criticized". it got an "A" score from CinemaScore and is 84% on Rotton Tomatoes. Seems like it was liked. Sure, but it's Metacritic & Rotten Tomatoes scores are high, but not too high, and one of the critical responses suggests some characters are in it for "their own aggrandizement" - that seems at least a little critical Well, i think there are for sure elements critics can for sure be critical about. Overall, it seems it was a solid movie done well. Especially comparing Bale with his work in American Psycho. It seems to be well received, with it's understable issues that might exist.
funny , my brothers also work here , they wear speedos at the pool ! repulsive , i tell you . i like the winter it is the best season better then summer . oh cool . winter is no fun , i cannot drive my sports car with the top down . i do not order on the internet i do not think i need to . well , we have the best spaghetti in town here ! my restaurant is the best .

It was funny, but slightly spiritual I guess it's one of those movies that critics will pan as bad, but a casual observer will enjoy very much. What did you think of Jim Carrey's performance? Jim Carey usually thrives very well in the physical type of humor. This movie fits his style very well. What did you think of Morgan Freeman's performance? Morgan Freeman Is an exceptional actor,and the role of God, fit him perfectly What did you think of the scene when he makes the other anchor act crazy? Steve Carrell killed that scene

I see, tell me more about it, might watch it later tonight. Sure, its about a biographical crime film from Spielberg based on Frank Abagnale, a con artist if you will. Sounds interesting, I dont know anything about the guy though lol. Frank Abagnale successfully performed cons worth millions of dollars posing as a Pan American World Airways pilot, A Georgia doctor and a Louisiana prosecutor. Interesting, so is he played by Tom Hanks? Frank is played by Leo. Ahh gotcha. Tom Hanks plays the part as Carl Hanratty. Ok cool. Whats the review or the rating of the movie again? average score of 7.9/10 and a Rotten Tomatoes score of 96%.
It looks like Jennifer Aniston is Jim Carey's girlfriend in the movie I like comedies, I'm just not a Jim Carey fan. JIm Carey is weird I agree But with Morgan Freeman and Jennifer Aniston in the movie, I can tolerate Carey. i think i will watch it The movie's score isn't that great.

The casting was also on point, DeCaprio did wonderful. Aslo Joseph Gordon-Levitt is always great! Yeah, when it starts getting into the subconscious it makes you wonder if science will ever expose peoples subconscious, and if we ever get the ability to, is that something we really want to have access to? The idea of shared dreams is so interesting. I wonder if they actually did this would it do damage to the brain. Ellen Page plays a great role. She is also one of my favorite actresses.
I couldn't agree more!  This movie would make for a great date night though, well, at least for the girl. lol What did you think of Ryan Gosseling's performance in the movie? I liked his role as Noah Calhoun I thought it was a pretty well acted what about you? did you like his performance I agree ,I really like it too.  I don't know if they could have picked a better actor.  He came off well as both young and wild but then later on as thoughtful and romantic as well. Yeah I agree, what about Joan Allen? did you like her? Oh man, she was fantastic! What are your thoughts? I liked her acting as well but liked James Marsden better Did you have a favorite part in the movie? Overall I think the cast of the movie was great I couldn't agree more! my favorite part is when Noah returns from war, That part made me cry! what about yours what was your favorite scene and yeah it was a touchy scene I really liked the boat scene for some reason.  It may not have been the best part, but it was so dramatic!  The rain just really made that scene something special! Yeah it was a good scene, what do you think of the critic responses to the movie Well, I agree that it is "must see" for those who enjoy mushy-gushy love stories. I think that they dont really fit the rating given by rotten tomatoes and Metacritic Score, the critic responses put the movie in a better light I agree with them as well
well my little sister does not like meat that much either
yeah its hard to put a whole book in a movie but in the time they had it was good and it was super trippy visually stunning Im gonna head out now have a great day I'm pretty sure we have to keep going? Though if you want to leave.. Sorry As someone who enjoys historical drama, do you think I would like it? ohhh I was under the understanding that we had to message eachother at least 15 times WAit until the finish conversation thing lights up. Might be a while longer I've done a few movie chats. probably not its really whimsical the movie ohhh okay thanks this is my first one no problem do you think you will see it Wow, no3 just gave a major spoiler! yeah right I think I might. Have to watch without kids probably hah you can probably rent it on youtube Oh yea I remember the cover, reminds me of him from wolf of wall street Though I honestly think I might like Gatsby better. I think I read it in high school What was your favorite part so far in the document? i think the 2nd part
i there , how are you ? i am good hope you are doing well i am doing alright . . i wish i was less chubby though i started losing weight when i moved to colorado . ow did you do it ? being tall and blonde i would love to be more athletic it is very cold here . i go ski sometimes .
maybe one day i could help you . . hang them up , that is . i am 6 3 ! whoa ! that would help as a curators assistant . . . willing to live in iowa ?
I still have trouble throwing away my kids toys because of the way the toys were given personalities and responded to being discarded. The voice actors were all amazing. I used to have an extensive collection of Army Men. My mom threw them all away. :( I guess to your point they were all screaming when they hit the trash can The CLAW!!!  I love the aliens and the crane game scene. Yes. Those machines are impossible to operate. I love looking for the Pizza Planet truck in all the Pixar films.
hey are inevitably going to affect our lives in different ways , unlike my job
It came out in 2014. So it's pretty violent What's the rating? It is violent. It got a metacritic score of 68/100. There is a scene where John, the main character interacts with the head of a Russian Crime Syndicate in New York City. what is the viewer rating? Is it appropriate for young teens? John was his best assasin, nicknamed Baba Yaga. I don't believe it is unless you want to expose someone to reality early. Keanu Reeves is great with martial arts. Are there martial arts scenes? Yes there is some mixed in there but it is mostly shooting. Very early in the film he is already killing everybody. Nice. He's fighting the Russian mafia? Yes. He is interrogating all these people and trying to find information. Any romance? Or only love for the killed puppy No not really it is just action for the most part. Who directed the film? David Leitch directed it. He's one of my favorite action directors I forgot to tell you there is a fist fight where he fights the villain Viggo. Cool. I assume John wins? It was also directed by Stahelski. There are more movies. I believe there are three made so far. He wins that fight though. He gets a dog in the end. What about the car?
i love stephen king , i have read all of his books . i do too ! my parents both passed but i used to read them to my mom .
I'm not sure. I mean, the Nolan movies didn't have much humor, but they were much more highly rated. I think it maybe just needed more story, overall, instead of so much just smacking each other.
i do not remember , but it was a funny song well i have to try and find that song . it sounds like it would be funny
dult toys ! are you a student ? i am . hat sounds intriguing . i am a student . what do you study ?

i play on the piano and paddleboard when i do not work . are you single ? i was married , divorced now
i owe 200 , 000 so i am about to lose my car
yeah do you reincarnate yourself
Did you know the film was 143 minutes long? It flew by. yea, it didn't seem that long. must have been all the action I know there was a lot of saving, but I still felt like it was Iron Man saving the day.
It has a 88% rating at Rotten Tomatoes. Yes, after learning more about it, I am definitely interested in watch the movie. I has very high rating from critics and the audience. woah thats 3 decades from now. its look like cool to know the story. Yes, it never hurts to learn something about history. I know I enjoy it a lot. yes we can learn more knowledge from the story specially when you really appriciate the movie. Meryl Streep plays sort of a journalistic hero in the movie. She makes a very important decision that changes everything. Yes, I totally agree with you. It does sound like it would be a thrilling movie as you watch how they make decisions and how it turns out. yes is meryl only publishing about it? yes im very interested about the story of the movie.
oh no . too much energy ? yea , but it is good , i fix planes and drive junk cars and fix those too hat takes a lot of talent . i do not do too much

That sounds interesting. Are there any famous actors to voice the characters? Ginnifer Goodwin plays Judy Hopps. Jason Bateman plays as Nick Wilde. Idris Elba is Chief Bogo, the African buffalo leader of the Zootopia Police Force. And Jenny Slate voices Dawn Bellwether, the mayor of Zootopia's diminutive sheep assistant. Nice! Did it do well in the box office?
ice . congrats . did you share it ? o , i did not because i do not like to brag lol my son shares everything he does . lol , my girlfriend and i love playing video games
yes Jaws the shark lurking in the dark' no
It was bound to be good when supervillians are trying to one up each other! What do you think about kids watching movies about supervillans though? Most animation is geared towards children I think it was a smart choice. Villians always steal the show in animation.

23 years ago! I feel old now Yeah, I know Apparently it has a perfect Rotten Tomatoes score Do you know how long the movie is? I don't but I think it's around 90-100 minutes I probably need to just buy the digital version, I lost the original a long time ago It's a good movie to have in a collection, I think A perfect score, wow, bet not many movies could say that Many movies that come out today seem like fails It can be a great family movie I think that Pixar often succeeds in these things by bringing in very nuanced emotions, like the fear of being replaced as someone's most loved person (or toy in this case) It has been so long since I watched it, I don't remember the storey line Andy, the little boy, gets a new Buzz Lightyear, voiced by Tim Allen and Woody, the cowboy toy played by Tom Hanks, is jealous because he's Andy's favorite toy Oh, I love Time Allen and Tom Hanks, both great voices. Yeah, and the movie also features Don Rickles and Wallace Shawn who have very unique voices Who does Don Rickles play?

I agree! It's crazy this movie was made in 2013! 5 years ago! Rating are an interesting thing - how does one say 74/100, another 89, and another an A+ What would you say is your favorite part of the movie? I have to say the "Let it Go" scene is mine I don't always agree with ratings! Some movies are really good and rated badly and some terrible movies are rated 90+ I agree My favorite part of the movie is probably when the sisters came back and finally had a huge party in their castle \ Ana really wanted to socialize :) Anna* well she was locked away for the most part Olaf is really cute interesting word "cryokinetic" used in that summary he makes the movie in some parts - he doesnt understand the seasons He really loved summer who doesnt especially when were are buried in a foot of snow here in illinois the movie is also timeless - people can watch it years from now and get the same feeling about it

The title is Batman v. Superman I love super hero movies, but not this one. ohh wow.. that's a good movie but unfotunately did not wacth it.. Are you a fan of Batman? ohh why maybe because two damn  good super hero fighting each other.. dont like that also ahaha yes yes Im a fan and also superman ofcourse and you? Did you see the Man of Steel? yes.. I like that movie too.. Did you know that this was the introduction of Gal Gadot to the movie world? Do you follow the Rotten Tomatoes ratings? really? did not that, thanks for that information, ahh sorry I dont, what was that all about? Is that a blog for criticizing a movie? Well, this movie got a rating of 27% out of 100% ohh.. that was too low.. poor batman and superman ahaha, much better they have their own movie.. Exactly. According to the critical response, this movie is all about fighting with no plot. I wonder what DC thinks after they make that movie.. yeah.. just to think of it that batman vs superman fighting with each other and so movie goers will think whos the bad and the good.. Did you know that Bruce Wayne has been serving as Batman for 2 decades ? Batman views superman as a threat to society. No, I don't know that.. ahaha that was too long.. Gotham City must be proud of.. Really why superman? maybe if I watched the movie I'll understand ..

whatever . samuel did not bite trisha , so i think we can house them together . . . i think so too . they might just fall in love ! well , it would be harder to adopt them to someone . but , if that is what you like . . . i do . i am falling in love with you .

Cinemascore is user ratings so both critic and audiences like this. I wasn't aware of that. Thanks for the info! Robert Downey Jr. is apparently great in his role. The key scene seems a little confusing. I wonder if the movie is hard to follow if you aren't a superhero fan. I think the Chitauri are a weird concept but aliens who want to blow up the world is normal.
i like dogs i have one named maddie i bet she is cute . animals really like me . we have four dogs in total but one maddie likes me more than the other ones i still have 20 minutes until my class . i am always so early !

This movie has all the great actors! I like the mix of all the classic heroes and Thor THE TALK VERY NICE yes THE MARVELS IS A2012 AMERICAN FILM BASED Chris Hemsworth is excellent in action movies and so is Scarlet Johnason It is based on Marvels comics I never thought it would be entertaining for adult but it actually is

Steve Carell, Jason Segel, and Russell Brand nice sounds interesting The villain uses three orphan girls to help with his plan what happened to their parents? I don't see that mentioned. oh okay does it say why the villain is evil? the villain does steal the moon, but the orphans get kidnapped

i like hiking . i take photos in the outdoors .
Rudy! Rudy! Oh, i heard of that one but i don't think i've seen it. I'd like too. Gosh, I can't believe blind side came out in 2009.  that was almost 10 years ago!!! i feel old. probably the last time i've seen it too. One of may favorite values shown in this movie is how Leigh Anne's friends are concerned that this boy is living in her house and she does not take their opinions oh yes. I remember that.  Good for her! And when he runs away! oh that got me! hmm i vaguly remember that scene.  Doesn't she go find him walking down the street in a car? I am not sure. I know that he had to work really hard to maintain grades good enough to play football.
This based on the true story about the Post attempting to publish the pentagon papers. Speil berg is a great director. Indeed. The setting is early 1970s America. Do you think this was a tumultuous time for Americans? A very different time from today, but tumulterous by any standard.. Do you feel it is important that people watch movies like this? Spielberg, I understand attempts to untangle the intrique of the events as they unfold. Yes, it is important to watch this type movie. Rotten Tomatoes gave The Post a score of 88%. Given just your knowledge of that rating, would you likely watch the movie? The Post in the movie attempts to do true jpurnalism a purpose, reviews can be slanted. I'd watch it because they rated it so low. (from the document) : "... The Post depicts the true story of attempts by journalists at The Washington Post to publish the Pentagon Papers, classified documents regarding the 30-year involvement of the United States government in the Vietnam War." Do you think that the actions of the people at The Washington Post could be considered heroic? Rotten tomatoes ratings are often way off. They don't take into account historic significance. One of the supporting actors is Bob Odenkirk. Are you familiar with that actor?
i like to run . i am single now too , looking for a boyfriend by chance ?
i did not it was so yucky out i weightlift and run in all weathers , 3 great danes lots of walks do you ever feel you do not reach peoples standards ? sometimes that is why i listen to all american rejects yeah they are pretty good i have seen them live do you like sweet potatoes ? i hate them i think they are alright . what food do you like ? seafood for the most part , new englander love a clambake very true where do you work hospital , as a scientist you ?

Haha yeah. I will have to check it out pretty soon. And wow I can't believe it came out in 2013. It's been that long already SO this task must not be working because we are supposed to move on to a new topic but i don't know what it is. Yeah, I don't understand it either. I thought there was supposed to be something too and nothings happening I hate to screw things up for you, but I think we might be wasting our time?
I was not impressed with the person they picked for Wonder Woman. In my opinion could have done better. I liked the graphics. Godd job. I was just thinking that. Good catch Well I liked Wonder Woman, but not the new Batman.
i bet , i have seen some pretty life changing videos about them
He certainly did.   And I think Matthew Goode was perfect as Hugh Alexander. Now that I've seen those people in those roles, I can't imagine anyone else playing them. I loved that Turing named his machine "Christopher". Such a sweet tribute. Yes. I loved that. Were you surprised when Turing proposed marriage to Clarke?
favorite was the magic bullet . had to write an extra book for that one .
i love enchiladas the most . i knew a mexican lady that made some awesome enchiladas sounds yummy yes and authentic
yes , this is a wonderful country .
i hope i get that many from all 5 of my children someday
zing ! new relationships are fun .
The trailers are what made me want to watch the movie initially. But now I've heard from several people that it's a good movie. Have you seen it before? I generally like anything that has Leonardo DiCaprio in it. I can see how this would be a good movie the plot seems to be very interesting. It seems like it would have a lot of action in it.
i have a decent amount myself hat is awesome but my family and i are not close hat is a bummer . i am not close with my family either i like being alone and hitchhiking
i matt here i wish i knew where i belonged well hello there matt i just moved to sweden and have no friends here

Jim carrey takes over steve corrells body and makes him speak gibberish live aha I have just looked it up on youtube. great scene indeed if I am not wrong, is not Steve Carrell that makes the sequel of this movie? like the main actor? i used to rewind that scene when i was a kid Yea thats him i think its evan almighty and it did not do well

y that is great . i miss those days
what do you like to buy definitely not vegetables , i hate those . do you like particular foods ? chocolate milk is the best

y what are you doing today ? watching game of thrones . what are you up to ? just bored af . . need something fun to do do you have any hobbies ?
Ok great, I have not but am interested in watching it. what type of movie is it a drama? It's a 2011 sci-fi film starring Hugh Jackman and Dakota Goyo oh i know those actors i and sci fi genre is exciting not sure about Dakota but of course I know Hugh Jackman and Evangeline Lily what is the plot about in the movie? so it's based on the short story Stee; Steel* oh thats interesting that was published in a 1956 edition of The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction what is the movie rated R or pg-13? it was even later adapted into a Twilight episode wow it sounds really cool not sure about the rating will double check did it get good critical reviews? ok so essentially, the premise of the movie is that human boxers are replaced by robots the reviews seem to be quite mixed, quite honestly ok sometimes audiences like the movie more then critics Rotten Tomatoes give it 59/100 But it sounds very interesting to me and Metacritic 5.9/10 eh im not put off by bad ratings since the plot intrigues me
hat is good to know . did your home sustain any damage ? one at all actually . what is new with you ? well , being president is tough . a lot tougher than owning casinos . what do you do ? i am a member of four different book clubs . hat is great . people should read more , including myself . it is very relaxing for sure .

Hey, what did you think of that movie, Toy STory? It was great, I loved the relationships between the toys I truly enjoyed the bonds that the toys had as well! I feel like the voice actors such as Tom Hanks and Tim Allen really made the characters come to life. Definitely, Tom Hanks really brought value to Woody's character Each toy is true to their own character That, they are! As the first computer animated film, Toy Story is such a masterpiece due to the amount of detail that is put into it. Yes, and the best part is the toys don't live as if they are toys. They see themselves as bigger than they are. its brilliant Not only that but they teach the viewers the value of perception vs. reality. For example, when Buzz Lightyear discovered he was but a toy. There are so many lessons within this story that young children can take away from this movie. I agree. I like how Buzz and Woody began as rivals for Andy's affection, then wwhen times got tough, they worked together to reunite with him. Mr Potato head is a great character, too. He for sure was but my favorite toy was probably Rex just because he was so anxious like i always am. Some other good toys are Bo Peep and Hamm the Piggy Bank. They work with Buzz and Woody throughout the film, like at Andy's party. It's great to have non-focal characters who are just as significant in a story. I really liked how the creators made the toys lifeless and brought them to life. As a kid, I always felt like my toys were alive when i was away so that was great to see on the screen. And who would think that little green army men could carry baby monitors and serve as lookout?? Very cool. Everything about the movie was pretty cool! Otherwise it would fail to average a 9/10 on Rotten Tomatoes Well, it was directed by John Lasseter. He is a talented director. I loved how from the very beginning, Woody and Buzz's feud was shown. It made their moments of bonding even better. Yes, I think the feud originated from Woody's jealousy of Buzz once he arrives and starts receiving Andy's attention.
i love novels about fantasy fiction . i like to read stephen king books reat what movies did your dad star in ? here where so many i cant name them all
sure , plenty to outdoors in mo
Yes. You can watch with the child splendid i will have to find it on netflix and check it out any other good movies? Geo storm hmm i havent heard of that one whats it about? It will be awesome. Must watch film. This film was massive hit all over the world. I was talking about Avengers. Hulk also will be there in Avengers
Hey! Have you seen the movie "The Blind Side"? I have not, but I have heard great things about it.  Anything in specific you can tell me about it that makes it stand out? Well, It's based on a book, so you know its gotta be from a well told story That's for sure.  Do you know what it covers basically? Its a biography, so it covers a true story. It's about a football player with a rough childhood I'm assuming the football player overcomes a lot of adversity as an adult as well? The movie focuses more on his early life, and his life as a young adult Ah, that's good news to me..I'm not the hugest fan of the sports side of movies.  So it's more on him as a person than the actual football? Yeah, there's certainly football involved, but the movie is mainly about how he overcomes adversity with the help of people that come into his life Do you know if there is any tragedy in it?  I do love me some drama here and there. There's quite a bit of tragic happening. The football player's mother was a drug addict Ouch.  Do you know offhand who's starring in the movie? Sandra Bullock is the biggest star. Her performance was considered great Ah, she's a great actress.  Do you know if any awards were won by the movie? Not to my knowledge, however I know the scores the movie got. It has an A+ on CinemaScore That's a pretty admirable rating.  Do you know who directed it? John Lee Hancock did Him I don't know haha, but if he's working with Sandra he must be good.  In your opinion is this a family friendly movie?  Like would my 10 year old be able to enjoy it? I think that with parental guidance the film could definitely be suitable for young audiences. Depending on your opinion though, the themes of this movie could be too heavy for a child under 13 Disregarding the themes, do you think it's a pretty easy movie to follow, even if you aren't a huge football fanatic?

I haven't seen any of her other film's, but I have seen a few interviews. She's pretty funny. I think she did, but I'm not certain. That is fun to see the interviews too. The snowman has quite a personality. Yes! Olaf is funny. It was great that the creators of the story offered a good bit of humor since it really is a sad story. And thinking of Olaf being a snowman and all, I have "Do You Want to Build a Snowman?" stuck in my head. haha Olaf added alot to the story. He really did! It was interesting twist to make the prince the bad guy. It was a creative twist from Disney for sure! Not that we could have know how Elsa would have responded to Hans' proposal to Anna, but really, you could probably back up and blame the whole fiasco on Hans. Yeah. I really loved Hans sidekick the reindeer too. They worked together well as a team with Anna.

He did. Walt Disney's Sleeping Beauty is tried and true but I liked how unique Maleficent was. Me too.  It's interesting how Maleficent was in love with a human, initially. Unsurprisingly, he betrays her for his own gain. What did you think of Stefan when he decided not to kill her? I think it was sad, because he may as well have killed her when he cut off her wings.  He used iron, which he knew would hurt her.  He is no better than if he killed her. Yeah, his character annoyed me. I really liked Dival though. His shape-shifting was pretty cool. Definitely.  I'm glad Maleficent got a companion. What I don't get though, is if she has the power to transform humans and animals into different forms, why didn't she transform herself back into a winged fairy? I guess it's the iron and magical fairytale mumbo jumbo.

Hi there Hi! Did you like the movie? Monsters University seems like it would be a funny movie Yes, I always enjoy a good Pixar. Interesting that it's a prequel. Do you think it was a good idea? Or, do you think a movie like Monsters, Inc should stand alone? I think movies that do as well as Monsters, Inc should be built upon No reasons not to make things more interesting and add to the plot. It received pretty good ratings and of course the actors have good reputations as well. I like it when sequels can get the originals actors to come back I totally agree. It does not work for me when sequels do not involve the same actors. The critics seemed to like the movie a lot, which is hard nowadays. Agreed! I get the sense that most critics enjoyed it and those who didn't only found it to be "okay". No one seems to think it was bad. Maybe safe, but not bad.
yea actually . when my husband is not at work . cool . i play guitar and video games . do you like music ? i do like music . but i enjoy being outside . mountain climbing , hiking , camping etc sweet . i like hiking with my dog , but he has some behavior issues oh yes i can imagine .

well , i go to several concerts across the country every year do you explore the different cities you visit ? of course , and i love visiting local spots to hear local bands play do you play any instruments ? i am more of an athlete than musician .
Yes, but the villains were fun to watch, I thought. The training sequence in the beginning was cool too! It was fun to watch the war scenes during the climax of the movie. They did so great with the graphics Yeah the training scenes got me hyped for sure! Yes, they don't really bother me in such movies. It was also satisfying when Wonder Woman chose to help the humans even though she say that they could be so evil. *saw*
i do not like music , i love it me too ! i play guitar . i like to sing , i go to karaoke every thursday hat sounds like fun ! there is not anything like that here in rural ohio . i travel a lot , in the winter i go to florida i have not ever been to florida . never even as far as cincinnati . you should get out more and see the world i agree . particularly if the band i am in is to find its big break . your in a band whats the name ? we are the ohio trio . my brothers and i .
wesome ! i am a little afraid of cars , as i lost my arm in an accident .

If I were him, I would have stopped while I was ahead. He might have done the same had he not been caught. I don't know much about his biographical life but I'm sure they nailed it. Wasn't it crazy how he escaped from the plane to get home?
oh , cool ! are you excited ? you should tell your best friend about the new career ! well i was a lawyer for a long time
Did you enjoy the film? Yes, Sandra Bullock was great. She got him to start playing better when she told Big Mike to protect his quarterback. I generally like her in everything-except that one movie with Melissa McCarthy (who I also usually like) I see.  When does the movie end?  Draft night? Well in this movie, she hired a tutor for the boy to bring up his grades so he could get into college.

Really? I feel so out of the movie loop. I am not sure but it probably is since its not a new movie I know Chris Pine anyway.. Really? What do you think about him? Also pretty cool that they have a female director doing a Wonder Woman movie. He is pretty cool, would like to see more him, so more inclined to watch this. Yeah they did a really good job, there are funny scene which is refreshing in this type of movies Oh cool, yea I heard that, but I don't see any mention of it in this article, they just keep saying it is a war movie. It is, but the way they portray it is a little funny, a bit of romance. Setting is in modern time and she is like walking with a big sword in the crowd like it is normal. Pretty funny lol that sounds pretty DC. I wonder how they procreated on Amazonia(?)
Hi! Hi! The movie is Toy Story Have you seen it? Yes, when I was a child it was one of my favorite movies what year did it come out? 1995 its been 23 years! makes me feel old Same here, I was born only a year earlier lo lol Do you enjoy animated movies? You still there?
Yes it definitely was. It was so sad. How about the true loves kiss. I didnt expect that..
oh wow . now that is cool . are you married ? o , i am not . are you ? yeah . big family . ten nieces and nephews . i come a small family . i only have one brother . hat can be nice too . so how is baltimore these days ? it is nice . the weather is getting cooler . hat is where michael phelps is from , right ? pretty cool !
Exactly! He is a great actor! I do agree that Paltrow was lackluster I thought that the character was pretty funny personally. I am not a fan of hers and she comes across as the same in everything she is in lately. Maybe not exactly what why there going for. I don't know I hear the name a lot but I hardly know anything she's in. I guess I really tend not to follow actors much. I loved the scene in the cave where he was held captive It has an Indiana Jones meets tech feel to if it And I thought Terrence Howard was great as Rhodey Oh yeah that's so true! It does invoke classic movies in several scenes. Rhodey was a great character as well! I felt like there was a real connection between the two of them. They had great chemistry, I wish Terrence Howard would return to play that part again It would be nice. I'm guessing it won't happen though. Either way they'll keep on making money! You know how popular these super hero movies are.
I don't know the director of this movie and haven't seen any super hero films ever.  Thanks for your education on RT!! Hes a pretty good director ive seen a few of his moives I have forgotten how many times we must converse on one film....  I like dramas for the most part.  Love Jennifer Lawrence! the film  in its self is a good started to the whole DC universe they are trying to create same film 15 times its a pretty standard set up I see Diane Lane is in this too.  She's a great actor with years of experience on the screen! The cast of this movie is pretty good to shes GREAT i loved her as the Martha Kent she stands out The critics may not have loved this film, but i think it had good preformances Aha.  I see the movie is about obedience.  Nice that it's not just action but has a message too! If you have young kids, or know any I think letting them see this movie would be good it teaches you alot about being a good person and standing up for whats right I have a 10 year old grandson and he loves super heroes.  Thanks bout the message about life.  Great info and I'm now excited to take him! also seeing Superman be treated as an "other" even tho he's a whote man makes you thnk alot

It's a children's movie BUT i think adults love it too. At least i do. There are two main characters monsters Mike and Sulley Ok, and what do they do? They always wanted to work for monsters inc (the big company where monsters scare children and children's screams are collected and it's the source of electricity in the Monstropolis) Mike is very educated but not scary and he really wanna be a scaring monster and sully is scary but he doesn't wanna study because he thinks he is scary enough do you care about ratings? Ohh, I see. Rotten tomatoes 79%, Metacritic 65/100 Well, I usually look at the ratings, but it isn't my main motivation Honestly, i think the ratings for this movie should be higher Can you tell me who play the main characters? It's really funny yes Billy Crystal as Mike John Goodman as Sulley Steve Buscemi as Randall
I have seen it, but it's been a long time hahaha how about you? Yes, I really like it. Its a really fun movie. I love the deep meaning behind it. Woody realizes he can't always be the favorite yes, indeed! that's what's amazing about that movie is the fact that it holds such a deep meaning what's the ratings it got? Yep. It got like 9/10 on Rotten Tomatoes and Cinema Score of A. Why can't they make more movies with great characters anymore :( how much of percentage did it get on Rotten Tomatoes? 100% HOLLY MOLLY! it deserves it Yeah, I know that is a rarity well, I think that Disney still make some amazing movies with amazing characters today like Up, and my personal favorite Inside-Out Sometimes. I like the old ones better though Oh yeah, inside out is GREAT. I actually think adults like the Disney Movies as much as the kids Hey do you know how much longer we need to chat? Oh I think we need to exchange replies, like 5 times not too long What is your favorite Disney Movie Wall-E and Inside Out and Up what are yours? Lady and the Tramp and Cinderella.  But Toy Story is great too because of Tom Hanks Tom Hanks brings Woody to life. Tom Hanks is just amazing I couldn't agree more with you Yes he is. Give me a whole new view of toys. I knew they came to life at night. Hahaha! Which is your favorite Tom Hanks movie? Toy Story hahaha, that's obvious no, seriously! I mean live-action movie The one where he is ship wrecked
haha yes, that's a good rating yeah, you telling me that makes it more interesgting Sarah Paulson is there too. do you like her? I do not know her but tom hanks I like so just because of him I guess I will watch it

You might say it was beautifully written, but like so many Hollywood biopics, it is disappointing because Turing's story is so compelling on its own. I like mathematics thats why its so interesting to me He had such a hard childhood when he was so unhappy and bullied yes he did a good job portraying Turing. It did pretty well on Rotten tomatoes. Yeah CinemaScore too, A+! Yes it's true he had a hard time in boarding school.

it was one of the best comedy crime film. how the scenes are produced? Yes, but critics thought it was a bit too narrow. The film was nominated for several awards including five nominations at the 86th Academy award.. Well it is reflected in its ratings do you know that?fuck is the word used more than 500 times in this movie?so funny..... It recounts Jordan Belfort's life when he was a stockbroker. ya ...it is a crime film but with lot of comedies..that is the major success of this movie Leonardo DiCaprio's acting was really good.
It might be hard to bring to life... but it was such a hit movie. I really liked the music. That would be hard to replicate in a live show, too. Oh, Definitely! Idina Menzel would have to play Else. There is just not other way around it. Yeah. She would be tough to replace. The summary that point number one gives is a little weird. I never thought that the parents separated the girls. I thought that Elsa separated herself. I like that Elsas powers are referred to as "cyokinetic magic" in this page. That sounds so cool. Ha! Haha. I just noticed that too. THat's not something I'd ever heard of before. I also liked the voice of Olaf. He's been great in some of the other Frozen storeis, too. Hm... yeah... I definitely agree with your point above! She definitely separated herself. Or did I miss something? Ha - I also didn't realize that the snow creatre's name was Marshmallow. His voice is honestly perfect for Olafs character. It's so cute and goofy. Lol! I love that! I knew Kristoff was villainous from the beginning, but he was so evil in the end!
how long ago ? years ? months ? bout ten years and six months wow , that is a long time . do you work ? yes i work and volunteer at animal shelters hat is good that you follow your heart . yes animals are where my heart lies ything else you like ? i like bicycling . yes and so does my son
yeah  that's a while ago when it came out the critics said it was a work of genius i think that we both agree on that? definitly it got a 100 on rotten tomatoes that seems great looking at the plot points made me remember some good sceens yes it did the critics also said tom hanks voice of woody is one of the best animated features in history yes like when buzz was trying to impress all the other toys with his cool new modern features yes that was great was it this one when they go in that room with that baby toy I cant remember I think so i get confuse with this one and two I remeber when there were trying to get on the moving truck it was fun remembering this one you have a great day bye well It was cool talking whit you have a good day bless yes
pretty darn good :) Awesome! So I hear you just watched a movie! Yes and you have got to see it!  Angelina Jolie rocks in Maleficent! Oh I haven't heard of that before, I do like Angelina as an actress too! Can you tell me a bit about it Yes, she's great in this.  It's a fairly new movie. It's sort of a dark take-off of Sleeping Beauty. Would you say its fiction then? Most definitely.  It starts out with Maleficent as a fairy in a magical forest in love with a peasant boy named Sttefan. Stefan. sounds nice, like a love story, lol something must go wrong.... They grow apart and Jolie becomes protector of the Moors, who King Henry is about to conquer.  She mortally wounds him and saves the Moors.  Henry swears that whoever kills her will inherit his kingdom and marry his beautiful young daughter. Are you with me? yes I am I'm enjoying the story, so essentially this king put a bounty on her head?

I have not actually seen it all the way through, just bits and pieces Okay, interesting. Do you know who acts in the movie? If I remember correctly, it is about a villain who tries to not be so villainous anymore Steve Carell is the voice of the villain He is pretty good in any film he does Great, thanks. I think I'll give it a shot. I know that my kid really liked it, she was really a fan of the minion characters

I want to see that! I do like the story line of Batman, though. critics say this movie is good this batman movie we are talking about
yes. that's why maybe the protagonists did not participate
it takes a long time for me to drive to my job , so i listen to it . do you like country music ? what channel do you watch ? i use my phone for music .
Is the movie in color? yes How old is the movie? abt 23 years

No I havent, have you? Yes. Are you a sports fan? Yes, are you? I was raised in a sports family and I am a movie fan. This is based on a true story. What is the true story? It the story of Michael Oher who in high school was adopted by a white family and with their support went to college on a football scholarship and was drafted by the Ravens in the pros. Oh wait I think I've heard about this I think I know the football player it was based on Was it good? It is a "feel good" movie that has a sports angle. Yes, a lot like "Hoosiers". I took my sons to see it. It really is a family movie. I've never seen Hoosiers, would you say Blind Side is one of the best sports movies ever? Michael was in foster care due to his mother's drug addiction. He ran away from foster homes. A coach of a private school recruits him into high school but he seems so far behind academically it seems impossible for him to graduate. It is a great sports movie! Why did he run away from the foster homes? abuse? It is also one that shows the bond of the adoptive mother and the ability for an underprivileged kid to overcome adversity. Is it also a story about racial harmony? I think he overheard from the foster parents that he was not welcome in their home. Because he was black? He was that and also very difficult to communicate with. Why was he hard to speak with?
12 Angry Man is a really old movie, it's a classic I highly recommend it and Birdman as well so what movie would You like to talk about ? ;) well, today we're talking about Iron Man have you seen it? ugh... part one You mean ? I did... very long time ago... hardly remember it... Did You liked itr ? *it ? yeah, the first installment I really liked it it was decent what was so good about it ? the casting was great the origin story, really it was well though-out really ? Other that Robert Downey jr, who was there ? the legendary Jeff Bridges oh yes ! The Dude ! :)
i , how are you and how old are you ? i am 18 britney spears touches me with her music .
Hello, how are you. What movie are we talking about today? hi....catche me if you can ...have you seen it? hello I have not seen it, what is it about It is about a fraudster ,  Do you like stephen spielberg movies? I love stephen Speilberg movies. Is it an action movie? no it is about a fraudster who plays an airline captain and various other occupations and cheats people. it is a funny /drama /real life film.. are you interested? Yes, it sounds like a great movie, I would love to see it. who plays in it? Great cast, decaprio, walken , sheen and tom hanks.... do you like these actors? yes, I like all of them. decaprio is probably my favorite.  Have you seen the movie more than once? No I haven't. It is a funny story. He is part french,s oh e is bilingulal and he starts teaching in a school as substitute french teacher when he is not a teacher. that is how he becomes used to fooling people . What does he do to fool them? He teaches, writes fake checks, works as an airline pilot and then starts kiting payroll checks from pan am. as a pilot that sounds interesting and funny. does he get into trouble for all of that? Yes eventually, Tom hanks is a detective who is looking for decaprio... he stole a lot of money this way...about 3 million dollars in real life oh that is great, I can see Tom Hanks as a detective. I can also see Decaprio as the bad guy, He has that look about him. That is so much money, I cant imagine. Is there any lead female roles in the movie Yes, hanks has a great role . H e finally finds decaprio, or frank in the movie and catches him. He gets 12 years in prison. Hanks plays a great role Yes there is a beautiful actress,French lady , nathelie Baye as franks mother Does the movie show him doing time in prison or is that just the outcome? Yes , it shows him in prison. Then he cuts a deal with the fbi for a shorter sentence to help them with bank fraud cases oh that is a great twist, helping after he just commited so much crime. Does he help catch anyone big?

Me too. That is way too low CinemaScore gave it an A which I think is fair. I agree with that one Did you like the story? Yes, I liked the story. I generally like movies that have a life lesson. Me too. They are more fun to watch I nearly forgot Steve Carell is in that movie too. I thought he was in part 2 He is in part 1 too, he was the news anchor who got the promotion.
I haven't read the book either. Nice I think I just have a biased opinion with Nicholas sparks books Made into films Do you read his books? I think it's cute that he tries to buy her a house in scene 1 When i was 15 I read a few Allie's mom seems rude What do you think of scene 1 Upper class family's in films always appear to be rude Yeah The ending I think really does it for alot of people Okay so this is during the WOrld Wars I like the vintage look in the first scenes It's getting sad at this point I think is 50/50 either you love it or hate it It seems like Noah's kind of like Gatsby in this scene since he's convinced a house is what will bring Allie back to him Material things
what kind of music are you listening to ? religious music . i usually listen to it when i play my favorite game what is your favorite game ? i like to draw in my spare time basketball . its hard though since i am fifty and female ! i love basketball , i am a tall woman so basketball came natural i usually do not talk this much , thank you for the conversation . you are welcome . in greece my family loved to talk to people i have a very deep love that is for my family ! hat is good , we came here from greece in the 50s cool . i want to go there someday , i bet its amazing . it is , and of course my specialty is ethnic food cooking i wish i had some mexican food now . i am starving . i would love to cook for you

What's your favorite scene? I always like the scenes where Iron Man is flying through the air and then lands with a HUGE impact, with his fist pounded into the ground. Oh I like the scene where he gets his orb of life I also enjoy seeing all of the cool tech and cars Tony Stark has. I'm not familiar with the orb of life. Please explain to me what that is. His chest center piece He needs it to carry all the weight of the iron suit he's not a superhero. he is just super rich Oh, I was not aware that was what it is called. Perhaps I need to watch the movie again. It's been a while since I've seen it. You're right. He only has lots of fancy equipment, no real super powers.

I do too I was very impressed with both of them, what about Frozen? I thought they actually did a very good job bringing the story to life in a different way Yeah I couldn't agree more with you. Did you have any favorite parts? Characters? Disney does a impressive job with animated movies. They really do. Its amazing how much detail they put into them. Jonathan Gross as Kristoff was my favorite character. how about yours? Even though he didn't have a voice I liked Sven. I love how Disney always puts in non talking characters in their films that help move the story along

The Minions work with Gru and his colleague Dr. Nefario to steal the Moon. Oh cool! They steal the moon! How? They have to shrink the Moon first, before they can steal it. that makes sense how could they fit the moon on Earth with out shrinking it! So are they inventors?

I have! Love Tom Hanks as Woody. Me too. I didn't know Joss Whedon wrote the screenplay...that's pretty interesting. Jim Varney's Slinky Dog is also a fave of mine. Me either Tim Allen was fantastic in this movie too. Steve Jobs was apparently a producer as well? I didn't know a lot of this stuff. Buzz, yes. loved him I had no idea either This was Disney's first feature-lenght computer-animated film I haven't seen the movie in probably a decade. I wonder how it would hold up as an adult. I saw it not too long ago. It was still good, but not like I remembered it as a kid I think we have gotten more used to computer-animation so it's probably less impressive than it seemed back then. Probably so. I forgot about Bo Peep!!! ANd Hamm the Piggy Bank They were always so afraid of being replaced. the party, christmas, lol I remember that this movie definitely made me think my toys were alive Do you remember THE CLAAAWWW It's funny how they basically wrote a whole movie over toys not wanting to be thrown out. YES. and the Aliens. "OOOOOOH, AHHHHHH" It's probably a metaphor for life somehow, like "we all want to feel valuable and like we have worth" Sid....ugh Sid was terrifying. Is this the first Disney movie where no one was killed off? A super rare occurence. Oooh that's a good question. Where was Andy's dad? I was just thinking that MAYBE that was Disney's casualty here What might be worse than Buzz...."a PUPPY!!" love that at the end, lol

but she played her role very well i liked that it was a different love story Love makes monsters of us all. true, or turns monsters into good people True as well. Was it a box office success? of course. i liked the part where she "kidnapped" the creature and kept it in her bathtub :)))) I think she could have had a better plan, but it fit the story Why not just transport to the harbor?

But it sure is a step up from the other superhero films I won't disagree with you on that one. Do you think the rotten tomatoes score should have been different? they are hard to please but they scored the movie better than metacritic, interestingly enough. I think it should is alright. It did have alot of popularity and made a huge impact. do you usually watch superhero movies? Yes I have watched all the Marvel Cinematic Universe films I'm not huge on superhero movies, this is the only marvel movie i've seen. Oh really. A new one is coming out next week called the black Panther. I heard it's a real game changer I could imagine. but back to this movie as I think we have to stay on topic to receive credit. What's your opinion of Loki's character? Loki seems like a real anti hero. He is the bad guy but sometimes he is the good guy. What do you think of Hawk eye? I have little to no idea what superhero that is. Is he in the Avengers? It's been so long since ive seen it, i don't remember all the characters Yes he is the one with the arrows. He is played by Jeremy Renner what is your opinion on the choice to make the organization known as s.h.i.e.l.d  a acronym that it is yes memorable but corny is my opinion It was alright can't recall what the acronym stands for. I'm not a movie buff at all. what other films did joss whedon direct? Don't know too much about him. hulk vs thor. who u think would win? Probably Thor. They made Thor too powerful in the film which makes him a bit dull. Them defending NEw York city was really awesome.

Okay, I see. Yeah, I thought she was cool. I liked the sloth He was good but I also grew to like the fox towards the end. It got a 98 on rotten tomatoes. That is very impressive That's very high, probably because it is so likeable and funny The story is really good Did you see that NIck was bullied as a child? Which character is Nick? He is the fox that eventually starts working with Judy, the main character. Okay, I don't remember him being bullied On IMDB, it didn t get as high of a rasting It was when he was younger and he tried joining the Ranger scouts, they stereotyped him because he was a fox. *rating Okay. It is still a pretty high rating, ecsepcially for an animated movie. I agree. I didn't know it was that high
I did. Great scene. Do you remember the name of the island Diana was raised in? Themyscira, right? Do you remember who Ares was unable to kill? Yes. Armes was unable to kill Zeus. Do you remember what the women in Themyscira called? Is it Amazonian warrior? I can't recall... Yes it is. ...is Wonder women from DC or Marvel comics? DC comics! Do you remember who forbids Diana to train as a warrior?

Ok. I will definitely have to look into that. It sounds like something the whole family can watch. I have kids so that is something I always have to consider. Maybe kids might not enjoy it. Depends. It's fairly safe for children, as I recall, but being at least a teenager would make it more accessible. Gosling plays a jazz pianist who REALLY loves the music even though it isn't as popular as pop. Have your kids seen other musicals? Yes. They like them. They love music and movies so musicals are something they watch every chance they get. Who does Emma Stone play? There's a seen where Gosling is hired to play at a restaurant during Christmas and starts doing jazz. The boss hates it, warns him. Emma Stone enters, loves what he's doing -- just as Ryan is fired on the spot. She tries to talk to him on the way out, but he's mad and walks right by her. Emma plays Ryan's Girlfriend That's sad. So how do they end meeting again? Ok. Months later, at a party. Gosling's in a band that covers '80s pop, which he hates. That's when they start to connect, sing that song, "A Lovely Night." That's great for them! It stinks that he has do something he hates. Later, after her auditions tank, Gosling talks Emma into writing her own play Does the play work out? Well, first they move in together. He gets a regular gig in a band playing fusion. He takes the job because he knows her mother is concerned about his employability. The band does well, but when she watches them perform she realizes he's not enjoying playing that kind of music So what does she do then?
He becomes one of the highest prospects in college football and eventually becomes a first round draft pick in the NFL No, he's black So a rags to riches story then? pretty much. quite touching though. And maybe with some racial undertones? based on the book so it's a true story Oh wow it’s a true story? That makes me much more likely to watch. yea it's pretty good. inspiring really. Did he get adopted as a baby mother was a drug addict and he went to foster care, kept running away he was adopted as a teenager in high school has a rotten tomatoes score of 69% Dang That IS a amazing Was he already playing football and the family wanted to help him or ride with him to fame Is rotten tomatoes from film ppl or actual audience? he was friends with their son in high school and they felt bad for him because he had no home and slept on the streets so they took him in and adopted him film critics

It took place on a fictional place called Amity Island They happen every year somewhere. Who starred in the movie? anyone popular? It has a great cast. Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, Richard Dreyfuss which is my favorite. I think I have seen it more than once but not recently. I have it. So from time to time I'll watch it. It's a classic. I like Richard Dreyfus too, I wonder if they play it on shark week I doubt it There have not been any new releases of sea monsters The fact that sharks are attracted to splashing and the Mayor would not close the beach just shows most people don't think it could ever happen but again it does. Did they call in some special shark hunter to catch it? And the boat they went out in was too small. No, Quint offered to catch and kill it for $10k

it definitely felt exciting, they projected characters emotions well. I woudl also agree with the critics saying its irresponsible glorification I guess thats why metacritic only scored it as 75/100 I remember his first phone call sounding super aggressive, and probably lying, and the whole room being impressed.

Cool. Would it be a good movie to watch with my girlfriend? It also contains Michael Nygvist, Alfie Allen and Adrianne Palicki If your girlfriend likes over the top action and isn't squeamish about violence, it can be a fun watch, but I'd warn anyone going into it about the dog plotline in case they would be upset over it Is it on DVD or available to download? Certainly Sounds like a movie I would like. Is there anything else about it I should know? I would watch it for the action sequences, but don't go in expecting Shakespeare  :P Haha. So the story line is simple? It was directed by Chad Stahelski in 2014, so I'd imagine it is available for download and dvd by now Yep, his dead wife's dog is killed in a break-in so he seeks revenge :P Haha. Sounds like a standard action movie plot line. Its not a very humorous movie, keanu reeves is very deadpan and its keanu reeves so if you've ever seen something by him, you probably know what you are getting from him Yeah he's not the most exciting on screen but I like his movies. I think i'll watch this one. Definitely seems like a movie to watch to past the time. there are worse ways to spend your time
True. I'm personally not a Keanu Reaves fan. I'm not really a fan of Adrianne Palicki either. How about you?

I will have to find out how Zuckerberg liked the film. yes that would be interesting to know. it's hard to imagine what it would be like to see a film like this about yourself. 96% on rotten tomatoes is pretty good. absolutely right! 2010 seems like a long, long time in the past doesn't it?

I usually don't like when singers become actors or vice versa but he did a pretty good job. I suppose I'd have to agree since i don't remember taking exception to any of the acting in the movie. Actually, I didn't even know it was based on true events until the credits were about to roll, and only found out just now that it was based also on a book. Me too. I knew it was based on actual events but didn't know about the book. I may have to look it up. I still like to watch the movie when I come across it on tv. There is so much more to the movie than that little blurb. I feel that doesn't describe so much of the movie. I think the actors that played the kids were well chosen also. I liked that they didn't chose well-known child actors that were already tied to other movies.
ope ! i also work at a grocery store and go to college part time y dad owns an appliance store . when he dies i do not want it . hahah that is funny ! what do you want to do ? people make me nervous so i always eat at home and watch netflix . whats your favorite netflix series ?

She was. I thought she was very serious about her role as Pepper Potts and very organized. Though, I never realized she would be a potential love interest for Stark. That did seem odd given Stark's personality, but the character needed an arc.
One of my favorite scenes is when Mike learns that the only reason he won is because Sulley tampered with the machine's difficulty level by making it the easiest setting. Oh reall? Looks like you enjoyed watching this movie. Who is the producer of this movie? It is produced by Pixar Animation Studios for Walt Disney Pictures. It is sad when Mike and Sulley are expelled and led away by the CDA for tampering with the machine.
hat sounds interesting what should i watch on netflix ?

i enjoy the fourth of july . i am very patriotic hat is a good holiday too . i drive and love my impala . is it fast ? are not those cop cars ? it can go pretty fast , yes like cop cars . i also listen to classic radio .
They actually have real connection y'know? Do you enjoy movies based on novels? Both actors are very easy on the eyes I'm sure that added to a huge factor Not necessarily When it comes to novels, I prefer the books over the movies but this was great. Do you generally watch romance movies? I agree with you there, books have way more detail. It sounds like the notebook was a great adaptation. I love romance movies. Mostly romantic comedy.

Hello! Did you recently speak to me about Batman Begins No, this is my first time here. I would like to talk about Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice Ok sorry about that! I recently lost connection with another person. It is ok! What did you think about the movie? Now... what do you think about BvS? Would you recommend it? I thought it was ok by the way It depends on you. I would definitely recommend it if you like superheroe movies because as a whole it has a lot of weak spots
i cannot afford to smoke . i only make about 30 thousand a year . hat is plenty enough to start , plus it will help you lose weight so i hear . i make cars by day . maybe smoking will boost my creativity . i doubt it mostly it just helps you look cool
Keanu Reeves is great in it! He plays an ex hitman who comes back from retirement after the death of his wife. There are alot of really great action sequences in it! Oh ok ok that sounds good, I'm aware that Keanu Reeves is the main actor on it but no idea whats the plot of it. So what year is this movie based like on the present, or more futuristic? It was made in 2014. Definitely not futuristic. Basically he comes back from retirement to seek vengeance after his vintage car was stolen and his puppy was killed. :( Yeah well I mean within the movie, when and wheredoes the story take place? Oh ok ok what kind of Vintage Car was it are you able to recognize it? It's set in the present in New York Oh ok ok So from who is he seeking vengance, who are the bad guys? I believe it was a Mustang They're Russian mob Oh ok, well he must have a hard time going against the Russian Mob. What about the dog what kind of dog was it? He was pretty much the best assassin and had quite the reputation. I'm not sure the breed, I just know it was a puppy that was a final gift from his deceased wife.
what did you go to school for interpersonal communications . what kind of food do you like i like chicken and beef and meat yum . i like to make lasagna and it s so good
i do not really have time for hobbies i have to study a lot i watch clouds on lunch breaks . he clouds can be beautiful and have many different shapes
well thats to be expected as she interprets elisa to the rest of the characters No rue. Being an the the one to interpret and making a sound decision are not the samething *true what im saying is that of course that character is going to be the voice of reason as she can speak and elisa cant wheras normally the main character would be the voice of reason Sometimes you have to look at things from a different perspective. it feels hard to do that when i feel like this has all been done before There are no new ideas. You have to find the beauty in everything. This conversation has been done before, but never between the two of us. lol there are almost certainly new ideas and youre probably right about the conversation bit

i love wearing pants . i also love to win . y parents were like that when they were in politics i am the only blue eyed person who hates politics . where are you ? i have brown eyes . . politics can really take the goodness out of you while you are involved
Macaulay Culkin when he is relishing being left behind. I also like seeing the family dynamics, like Kevin and Buzz fighting. you still here? or rush out to go watch it,lol? yes i am I am surprised it did not get a higher score. talking about it makes me want to watch it now Rotten tomatoes only gave it 62%. You should watch it again, always enjoyable and fun. what that is a classic I know. I think people love it. That is why that score is surprising.. well those critic don't know a good movie So many good actors in it too. joe pesci, daniel stern as marv, john heard.. sometimes I wonder if they do .. what part don't you like Ya soem critics are so harsh, one says,' flat and unsurpring as its cute little premise suggests" I love it all. I catherine o'hara as the mother and her whole struggle to get back. come on you must not like one part of the movie is there a part you don't? I really loved this movie. I can't think either because it was a good movie well there yougo. Well I guess I didn't like two robbers bothering kevin. lol

Did you enjoy the film? I loved it! How about you? It was pretty good. Do you feel it was one of Spielberg's better films? I don't think it was his best film, but it is definitely a crowd pleaser. It makes the viewer feel like everything you want is within reach with a little bit of luck and creativity Who was your favorite cast member?

Ive almost watched it a few times, i will have to now. looks great. do you usually like those types of movies Yes I do do you yes, I enjoy romance movies,but i see its a romance drama, it looks great though and I like leonardo diccaprio also. even though its written in 1925  its set in 1931, Nick Caraway who is played by Tobey Maguire moves in beside Jay Gatsby. He is Daisy's Cousin. interesting. actually It begins in 1931 its based in 1922 sorry for the misinformation i like toby mcguire i saw hes in it too Yes he plays Nick Caraway The key scenes looks interesting also, where nick is a war vet and in a physc hospital. Yes was there any part of the movie you didnt like. I actually liked the whole movie. It shows you how they lived back then but with a contemerary twist to it. do you have any questions about the movie that I could answer Do you know the rating? Rotten tomatoes 48% and an average of 5.8 / 10 Metacritic score is 55/100 The cinema score is a B

well , i do like cheese cake ! ir is yummy , but i prefer chocolate cake ! yum ! i like any kind of cake but carrot . . . yuck !
yes Who was your favorite character? it would be  bruce i guess Yeah, that was probably a dumb question on my part. Second favorite? LOL. james gordon i always like him He's my second favorite, too. Gary Oldman portrays him perfectly.
Oh definitely! I completely agree! It didn't help that the two sisters were already distant.
ok there were many I get that It was a real good movie when they went savage What was your favorite animal? the bunny also the fox Yeah that was a good scene I liked how they tricked the sheep With the blueberry yeah that was good
Have you ever seen Bruce Akmighty? hey whats happening Almighty yes, Apparently it sucks. Rotten tomatoes have it a 48% eating Eating Sorry pc keeps changing it rating that movie was funny as hell Yes but it didn't utilize jim Carey's talents it was alot better than the second one true, carey is an amazing talent He is great in slapstick scenes but Bruce almighty had too many "serious" moments totally agree His character Bruce is in a serious relationship but likes someone else in the movie. If you have Jennifer Aniston why would you want someone else? People didn't like that they tried to push a message way too hard jennifer is smoking hot she is a very good actress That's true. Be satisfied with your life. I think a lot of people need and deserve promotions like Bruce so saying it doesn't matter and to be happy probably upset people Saying yes to every prayer probably made people question the believability in the movie. Heading voices was also a turn of events
i like pizza and meat , what is your father ?
is about all these social networks Oh sounds interesting, whats your favorite part about it? the part i  like the most is how they let u know how much the creator of facebook struggled at the begining to start his social application Oh so it's like a real life situation. Sounds interesting, is it a movie? do u recall any part of the movie yes I haven't seen it oh no ? , u should watch it I should perhaps, what else is interesting about it? well for example one of the first parts is that zuckenberg was dumped by his girlfriend as soon that happened he went and wrote on his journal abbout  it Awe that's rough, I really like that this movie is like a biography and made that public and call it facemash
It has Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield, Justin Timberlake, Armie Hammer, and Max Minghella That is a pretty good cast. What is the plot of the flick? It's about the founding of Facebook, but no one on Facebook's staff were involved in making the movie so its like an unauthorized biography... Yes, pretty much. I suppose that makes it more objective and less of a Facebook ad how accurate do you think it was? I would guess that it was pretty accurate. I just received a new paragraph. It talks about how it all started because Mark Zuckerberg was dumped by his girlfriend and decided to post an insulting blog about her. Then he ended up making something called Facesmash to rate the attractiveness of female students at his college that could get pretty controversial. about how long is the movie? The information I have doesn't say, but I would guess about an hour and a half or two hours are the vinklevoss twins represented in it, and if so, who plays them? Yes they are. Armie Hammer plays both of them hahaha. that is pretty funny. I just got more information. It turns out that Facebook started with just Harvard but then was extended to Yale, Columbia, and Stanford. It was also originally called "Thefacebook" but they met with the co-founder of Napster who suggested dropping the word "the" I remember when "the" was in the title. totally funny. do you think I should see The Social Network? Yes, I think you should. It seems like a pretty interesting movie and the fact that it has a good rating is a good sign I know it was written by Aaron Sorkin, who I think also did the west wing. His writing can be good, but sometimes it is hit and miss. Yes, it was directed by David Fincher too if you have any interest in him. It says it was actually adapted from a book
y wife left me , but i love new york so i think i will move there i recently changed to nights full time . no swing shift . i did a half marathon ! 1 2 marathon is very impressive . how do you like nights one of my two dogs i own follows me when i train . i love nights ! what kind of dogs do you have he training just finished a month ago . poodle and a labrador ice , i have a yorkie and a great dane wow ! two totally different sized animals !

From start to finish you're engaged and you get a sense that Iron Man is human and has flaws but it's fun to see him overcome them, while keeping his sense or humor and spunk. of* I do also think that director did give the movie a military theme.  It kinda had a strict undertone
Jonah Hill did a great job in it too! Only in murica Yea he did he does a good job of being a druggy lol his epic "steve madden" scene haha oh yea and a movie using qualudes lol expired ones at that very accurate for the times he "thinks" he drove his car home fine lol good movie overall, now i want to go watch it again :)
Yeah, I'm more of a sci-fi person, too. I'm not a big fan of any of the Nicholas Sparks movies because of that. While I didn't find The Notebook to be sappy (probably because of personal stuff), I can't stand the rest of his movies. Well, movies based on his books anyway I can agree there. Sci-fi is good for me, even if hollywood doesn't seem to big on it. I haven't read much of Nicholas Spark's books, been meaning to read the Notebook though, just for reference. Ah, they updated the page. I didn't realize it was set in South Carolina!

It's not until reality hits, like it did when Woody and Buzz Lightyear gets separated from Andy and his family, do we come to realize we are limited to the support of those around us. Teamwork is everything. I didn't know baby monitors could be so versatile. The toys used them to report to other toys. Yes, I also liked the creativity of escaping the bad situations in the movie that the characters faced. Like using the RC Yep. Ooh and what about how often Buzz and Woody were confronted with conflict. It was nonstop. You see how Sid's dog interfered with their progress.
rasshoppers and makes sure it is cooked sounds like a good plan
I dont remember who Marley was? roberts blossom he is a great actor i should say he was. I dont recall which character though?

the intro was a great way to start a movie yes and i like that samuel jackson was in it and ironman was great and added to the movie yes he was a team player i loved how loki was being bad and how clint barton was aiding him in his escape yes and how he was able to open the worm whole the plot of this was very awesome i think that loki beinging the bad guy helped i hope that we can see more about him i like how the other agents were controled yes it made for a tense scene and how thor fought hulk and how they finally had to band together after a tough time yes that death made a big impact on them and how loki started his attack on the earth i like how they fought in new york and how hulk beat loki up lol that was good
Yes, and he is somehow able to make Batman believe that Superman is bad.  I think it is a cool idea, but it was not well liked by critics. Yeah sounds kind of crazy! Batman is played by Ben Affleck. Superman is Henry Cavill

i like that , also . all pizza . hat is cool . do you like to read or listen to music
yeah, you're right the casting was really great and it really made a difference Robert Downey Jr was PERFECT for the role of Tony Stark I think the part in the critical response that discusses how the film felt like a military thriller. That makes it a little different than a typical action movie that is just full of action and special effects. and of course, let us not forget the legendary JJeff Bridges as Stane yes, you're absolutely right it didn't feel like a heavily-CGI'ed movie

wells it takes place in a world where anthropomorphic toys pretend to be lifeless whenever humans are present, the plot focuses on the relationship between Woody, a pullstring cowboy doll and Buzz Lightyear, an astronaut action figure. They fight for the affection of Andy, their owner. They later become friends and work together to be reunited with Andy as his parents prepare to move homes! Doesn't that sound amazing? That does sound awesome! Any other cool plot points? well the plot also contains an array of extremely cool other dolls like Slinky Dog, a dachshund slinky toy played by Jim Varney! and Rex, a nervous green T-Rex figurine played by Wallace Shawn Nice! Who play's Buzz and Woody? So Woody is played by the amazing Tom Hanks, and Tim Allen, another great actor, plays Buzz!! I think this sounds like my kind of film... anything else cool about it? well, it's a film that received a perfect score of 100% on Rotten Tomatoes! That should tell you how amazing the movie is. There's also this very interesting scene where Woody organizes all the toys in a scouting mission during Andy's birthday to find out what new toys he got! Green army men toys spy on the party and report on baby monitors. All of them are happy to find out they haven't been replaced by new toys, until Andy receives a surprise gift-- Buzz! It all makes for an interesting story line That sounds like something my kids would really enjoy! I love the rating!! yeah it's perfect for kids. It's a comedy with animation and a lot of Adventure. It is an older film, produced in 1995, but it still holds to this day Oh wow. I guess it's stood the test of time. I like animated comedies! This movie sounds pretty neat.
Wait... right Haha sorry Do you have any recommendations based on Inception that you think I might like? Hmmmmm,  not a movie but have you seen the show Black Mirror? Alright well, if you like Nolan you should check out Interstellar and Dunkirk. Both legit Did you get the next document? I have seen both and they are amazing. On netflix? I saw 2 eps and quit real quick lol. Too "out there" for me Interstellar may be my favorite movie. MINE TOO WORD But no, I didn't take a doc My task list says the other user will get one "The other user will read a document about a movie." Oh yeah I have this document with a bunch a facts about interstellar Copy and Paste some to me Lol Might be interesting, who knows Won't let me copy it.
I do, I love superhero movies, what about you an english actor named Christian Bale I don't care for them very much This one is more grounded, not as many special effects Never heard of him What else does he play in He was in American Hustle Hope many Batman movie were needed do you know? American Psycho Well this is one of the better batman movies, definitely has the best cast Who else is in it? Who played the joker? Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman, Michael Caine I love Morgan Freeman The joker is in the sequel to this movie, heath ledger plays him in that movie He's played in a lot of great movies Didn't Heath die? Yes, he plays a good character he did, a few months before that movie came out too which was sad I thought that's what happened I have seen Catwoman A little bit of Batman Yeah, is in the 3rd one of these movies played by anne hathaway thats cool Just couldn't seem to start interested in it Bye have a good day!
well that makes sense . how did you find that job ? dad put an ad on the college bulletin boat family is always helpful . hopefully you have a great day today !

lk and deer mostly their my go to meats

The Post? What is it about? It is a political thriller. A political thriller? Is it a historical movie or based on real events? Who stars in it? It is a historical movie of a news paper's struggle against the government written my Steven Spielberg starring Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks. Wow, Spielberg Streep and Hanks huh? Sounds like a pretty good lineup. Do you know who is directing it? Steven Spielberg. Makes sense I suppose. Is it coming out soon, or is it already in theatres? It is a 2017 movie. Ah, so it came out already. I suppose I'll have to check it out from rentals or on DVD/Blu-Ray. Were the reviews for the movie good? Good directors and actors do not necessarily make a good film of course. It doesn't say.  But backing up a little, Steven Spielber produced it, but Liz Hanna and Josh Singer wrote it. Ah, thanks for clarifying. Two totally different levels of involvement in the movie there. It still does sound interesting though. When they say the Post, do they mean like the Washington Post? I know they were involved in a couple of big things like Watergate. Ellsberg who became confused by Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara is the one who photocopies the classified reports documenting the 10 year involvement in the conflict of Vietnam. He then leaks these documents to the reporters at the New York Times. Ooh, Vietnam War stuff. There's a lot you could do about that. So what else happens after the leak? Maybe it is talking also about the Washington Post because the Post assistant editor tracks down Ellsberg as the source of the leak and attains the copies of what Ellsberg gave to the New York Times.
hi hello Seen any good movies lately? Seen Despicable Me? Yes, have you see it? Yeah, I liked it\ It wasn't as deep as other animated did you know that Steve Carell played Gru? I don't think I did I like Russell Brand I liked that they made Gru a "good" bad guy that was weird 'cause there wasn't really a bad guy an antagonist or was there? I would consider Vector the antagonist don't remember Vector was this before Disney bought Pixar? he was Gru's archenemy. he was the one that stole the pyramid seen too many movies did this one have the little yellow creatures? yes the minions assisted Gru with his plan to steal the moon I remember the moon stealing stuff minions, yeah Wall-E is my favorite animated movie. you? I haven't seen that one. it's awesome its' deep funny, cute, sad I also liked the one about all the emotions in the girl's head I don't think I saw that one either.do you agree with what the critics said about Despicable me? I don't remember it well enough I remember liking it But not loving it
I think Gru is awesome. He makes a great main character. I notice it has great reviews from the critics as well Yes, it does. Again, I believe the ratings don't quite show how great this movie is. Steve Carrell plays Gru, I notice. Sounds like a strong performance. I love how the movie shows a rivalry that isn't between hero and villain, but villain and villain. Yeah, I agree. I've also quite often found that ratings (at times) are not reflective at all of how good / bad a movie is. Yeah, that's definitely a new twist. I personally think that Mr. Coffin and Mr. Renaud did a great job directing, Sounds like movie has great humor, action and heart! From what I read of the plot, it also sounds like there are quite a few twists and turns... It truly does. I also find it interesting that Mr. Perkins (the bank president) is Gru's rival's father. Yeah, that's interesting and I think his minions sound cute too. As well as the three orphan girls. Mr. Perkins CONVENIENTLY decides that Gru isn't the man for the job of stealing the moon. They do sound cute. I love how Gru starts to warm up to them at the theme park. The whole plot is just so imaginative to begin with! Stealing the moon, how creative is that? All-in-all, just a very captivating film with an engaging narrative and imaginative characters... I know! I think that Vector is just a horrible person. I love that he was left stranded on the moon.
Wow, that does sound interesting! I have heard about other David Fincher films, and the only ones coming to my mind are "Alien 3" and "Seven" a crime ovie excuse me, a crime movie Ooo those sound intriguing! Yep. Any reviews of that movie you have heard of?
reat ! yellow is my favorite . when is a good time to visit ?
hat is true . so what do you do for fun ?

Hey how are you doing today? Have you seen the Wolf of Wallstreet? Im doing well, thanks for asking! Real good and I have not yet, whats it about? It starts Leonardo Dicaprio and is directed by the famous Martin Scorsese I love Scorsese films so this is sounding good, I was actually looking for a movie to watch later
so the movie also talks about race Yes then where does football come in to it?
surprised the rotten tomato score was that low Billy Crystal topped if off yes indeed Yes, Rotten tomatoes was tough on it. Mike striving to become a scary monster was fun to follow What did you think of it as a sequal Pretty good.  This one was best The return of characters made it memorable and fun oh yes i ndeed The metacritic score was hard on it too. the scare games contest was captivating I did like the Cinema score was A though It definitely was a good comedy. yes that was an appropriate score When Mike and Sulley got expelled I thought that was it Mike was aspiring to be a scarer and always most cool as a monster I feel for the monsters and having to prove themselves. Did you like the Oozma Kappa And they had to work their way to become part of the scarer team good lessons for kids yes i did They were the weakest fraternity for the kids but misfits Mike is in yes it was They did do a good lesson for kids and Sully tampering to let Mike win was a lesson in itself they did well in the games
i reside high in the mountains hat is cool i work at a small urban farm to grow vegetables i love me some good homegrown veggies hey really taste better when you grow them yourself hey do . and especially cucumbers hose are good what other things do you like to do i love bellpeppers and squash hose are so good to cook with

Have you ever read the book that is mentioned in the text called Queen Bees and Wannabes? The directions said that we're only supposed to discuss what we see on the chart and not any other knowledge that we have about the movie. I love the fact that Rotten Tomatoes named it in its "Top 50 Greatest Teen Comedies" in November, 2012.

Great movie huh? It's alright.  Got some funny moments but its fairly forgettable Really you think its forgettable? Yeah.

It is certainly integral. Kevin draws inspiration from it and uses the sound clips of the gangster making threats and using his tommy gun.

Hello! Hi! Just reading about "The Blind Side" movie - have you seen it? I've never seen it. What's it about? It's got a few things going on - family (well-off folks adopt a poor teenager), sports (teen's a football star, how will he get into college?), and some social commentary about all of the above. Oh, and it's based on a true story.

Sounds interesting.  Who is in it? The protagonist is Macaulay Culkin. He goes by Kevin in the movie. I remember him. It has Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern too. Is it a serious movie? Nope. It is a comedy. That's pretty cool.  I might like to watch a comedy with Jo Pesci. When did it come out, do you know? Yes, he is interesting! but it is surprising that the movie is not rated that well. it came out in 1990 I typically can ignore reviews for a fun movie.  If this fits that bill I may go ahead and watch! Sure! The first half is cute, and the second half pulls you into adventure! you may want to watch it

Go back where? hello?
I have. I thought it was really good I was really amazed at Leonardo DiCaprio's performance in it. He was truly spectacular. I think it really showed the excess and craziness of stock trading world Yes it really made you feel like you were right there on Wall Street. I've always wondered what really went on in those firms. I really liked the part where the yacht got caught in the storm and they had to be rescued Oh yeah it's funny how just having money doesn't necessarily elevate you above everyone else. and how drugs and excess can ruin anyone Yeah that is a really good thing that everyone should always remember. I think all of the characters did someone learn that lesson though. Who was his buddy in the movie? Jonah Hill? He was a good actor in this movie Yeah Jonah Hill was an incredible actor. You forget where he started... Where did he start? Was he a child actor? Maybe not. Lol I think I'm getting confused with the Jonas Brothers... That would of been a weird movie considering the Jonas brother's background Wasn't his buddy married to his sister or something weird in the movie Yeah. But it would have been an effective way to get inside the drug induced worlds that they were living in. I believe so. I can't remember all the relationships. I always find those things sort of complicated. and the funny thing is Leo is as a big of a player in real life as was Jordan Belfort was Yeah all of these based on real life movies totally twist the reality part and make it into their own real world Don't buy penny stocks btw. It's not that they're a scam it's that scammers love them

Frank and Carl seem to get along well too. I mean, with everything going on they still show up to work together and take care of business. That is true. Do you typically watch this genre of movies ? Not really. I tend to watch more romantic comedies. How about yourself? Same here. Those are my favorites. But this one is quite interesting in my opinion. I agree. I like that it is a Spielberg film. That brings more appreciation I am actually surprised it was a Spielberg film. Didnt know that untill now. Do you agree with the critical responses? Yes and no. I agree that the length of the movie was a bit long, seemed bogged down. You? A bit yes. Isnt it crazy to think someone doing that much illegal stuff could actually in fact end up helping the FBI? We rarely see that nowadays. Well it looks like we can finish our conversation. It was lovely chatting with you! Catch me if you can!
Hi, have you saw this movie? no what's it about?
d a bad headache from losing the alcohol i relied on so we have both been throwing up every day but for different reasons . yeah . have you ever thought of living in a storage locker ? i have been sick every day for 3 months straight . re you still with the father of the babies ? o but i would not mind putting my other 3 kids in storage for 6 months . you are gonna have your own little soccer team soon yes he is 36 years old with a good job but i am only 26
hat sounds like hard work .
Lol. They were thieves... It's part of the point of the film. The parents weren't portrayed as particularly 'bright' people.  Caring, but not bright. Typical of many parents, more concerned with their wealth and vacation than their children Again their neglectful nature is what set the plot into motion It's a film, it's meant to be exaggerated... I believe you're supposed to talk more about specific plot points, (What's happening in the movie) as each of the new parts come up for you on the screen you haven't been doing this... I can tell this movie is a favorite of yours.  How many times have you seen it? 5 What was your favorite scene in the movie and why? The paint cans in the face down the stairs just humorous in general Still with me?
do you have any pets ? my dog , socks , lives at my parents house . i do not . i want a dog , but my son is blind and i worry he would trip . i am in college and work with blind children . some dogs can be trained to help . hat might be a bit much for me to do at the moment . do you drive ? i just bought a lexus and the color is silver .
Is it good? Did you like it? its my favorite movie to be honest .. you need to see it ! Wow, that's quite a statement! Is it similar to any other movies you've ever seen? its similar to the movie blow Interesting. What kind of stocks does he trade, or what exactly makes him the "wolf of wall street?" rotten tomatoes rated 7.8 out of 10 thats pretty good Pretty good! What else can you tell me about Leo Dicaprio's character? he trades really crappy stocks and tricks people to thinking that the stock will climb the ladder when in reality the stock is garbage hes basically scamming rich people his character is very funny , hes a drug addict in the movie with lots of energy Ah, so he's basically running a scam? Does anything come of it? Does he go to jail or get caught? I dont wanna ruin the movie for you but he does get in some trouble in the movie , police do get involved Thanks for that! I just want to know as much as I can without ruining it. Any other interesting characters? Jonah hill is in the movie ! hes basically leo's best friend in the movie and helps with the scams Oh, that's cool, he's a funny dude. Is this a true story or is it made up? Its a made up comedy ! Very cool! Do you know if it won any awards?
drinks ! are the best lol
sure , i am into rpg computer games ! hat is creative . i like to write cool . i have a co worker who likes to write . i actually have a crush on them do they know how you feel ? o , but i am thinking about telling them when friends and i play tabletop games you should . life is too short to keep that in i am slightly embarrassed i live at home still though hat is not embarrassing in this economy hank you . that gave me a confidence boost . what do you like to do ? i enjoy nature walks like hiking oh that sounds fun . maybe i should try that sometime here is nothing better to feed the soul what else do you have planned for tonight ? ood nights sleep i suppose . you ?
wesome do you have hobbies ? i give blood and job oh and netflix
Not really I think it is too fictional I agree Do you think the cast was a good pick ? I think the cast is ok. I liked Justin Timberlake as Sean Parker Jesse Eisenberg is a strange choice. He just doesnt really fit the roll Yes, I agree The twins actor is spot on It is not too much biographical No they really play out the drama to an overt lengths I feel LIke a soap-opera How do you feel about the scenes being cut with flash backs I think it is overdone It feels like poor story telling when flash backs are used Yes, I agree
i think superman would look better if his suit was purple i do love purple . i also have an autograph collection of over 2 , 000 autographs . wow that is crazy do you have any from the actors of clueless ? yes ! i have alicia silverstone . i also like snakes . i have two . i want a snake but i have hit my limit on my credit hey are great pets ! i just started an organic only diet . ow is that going ? can you still eat meat ?
Yes. I loved it. I think most would and did considering the scores, 93% on metacritic, is very high. Rotten tomatoes score was 92%. are you there still? You are taking a very long time to respond at all. Are you doing a nother hit at the same time or something? I'm here! SOrry my computer froze. Well maybe there is some glitch and you got disconnected or you are busy somewhere else but i have waited 5 minutes.
i am sorry why did you have to run i wife really wants the running and my kids oh ok . what do you do for fun
maybe i will go to college in canada so i can do some hiking there . . i study special education
Yah all the voice actors return.  The scene that I mentioned earlier is my favorite. I sort of don't want to spoil it for you oh ok and is it PG ? i have a 2 year old .. i would to watch it with him if he lets me
yeah i too Chris Pine made a nice addition to the film as well. He played a nice supporting role. yeah i love it all character nice movie So you agree with the ratings the movie was given? What did you think when you found out Wonder Woman was Zeus's child? Danny Huston played the bad guy role well. What do you think? yes  danny huston played well How do you like other DC movies? Anything else about the movie? I have essentially carried this entire conversation Anything... Hey guy i like that movie
what are your other hobbies ?
because i love food . all i do is eat . y dad was a fat mechanic ! what did you last eat ? i just want to feel beautiful . you can be fat and beautiful , i promise . i know i feel like my mother . is that a good or a bad thing ? i am going to write a song about you bad . because i am a mother . you are a mother and feel like your mother ? that does not sound too bad .
yum . sounds great . one of my favorite foods
Not sure what that is exactly Night Fury was the main one...the "hero" of the movie. Do you remember his name? Nope It was "toothless"! :) Don’t think I’ve seen the movie you are taking about Oh, well you should watch it! What is it? You can watch it in 3D, or 2D. It's called "How to Train Your Dragon". Oh It's really great fun for all ages. Who is in it? Is it animated? Jay Baruchel, Gerard Butler, Craig Ferguson...etc. Yes, it's animated. When was it made? 2010 Is it a comedy or more serious? Definitely a comedy. It has some really funny parts, but serious stuff too. Interesting. As it deals with dragons 98% on Rotten Tomatoes! How long is the movie? I'm not sure, but around 2 hours I think...probably a little less. Might have to see it. Do you recommend in 2D or 3D?
we should start a pro transit political party and take over . i am down , let us do it !
I haven't either, but it looks to be a good movie. It stars Merrell Streep and Tom hanks. I think both of them are really good! How about you?
I think that is pretty good and how things go , it also reflects the struggles of women entering male-dominated spheres Yes, it had a very inclusive message. yesis a great movie for kids and adults
For example, in one of the scenes you watch from the swimmer's perspective. One of the shark's victims is in the ocean and you see her disappear under the water, then later they find her body parts. Omg... that is horrible. How many people died from a shark's death? I'm not sure, but I know the police chief tried to get them to close the beaches, but the mayor wouldn't let them because he didn't want to lose the tourist money. That's not right at all. Only one shark attacked people or multiple ones? It was just one shark but they had to pay a shark hunter $10K to kill it, and on top of that there were a bunch of amateurs trying to hunt the shark, too. I bet the shark put up a good fight with the hunter.
Well now I understand how they forgot him at home.  They were rushed to get to the airport. Once they realized they had forgotten him, they made every effort for the mother to get home. you see kevin returns home with numerous booby traps that was a excellent scenario i think as well as suffer various injurious too
y there , how is your day ? its going good and yours ? pretty good . my work is in construction but its raining today so just reading . we get kinda allot of rain too . i hardly rained when i was serving in the army in the middle east . yeah sucks i just my wife hates the rain . that is what we moved to wisconsin . i like reading romance novels in a rain . not typical for a guy like me . lol
y how are you today ? reat ! just go off work at the smoothie shop . you ?
so you use the computer all day at work ? i fix other peoples it problems my ex used to work in the it field . sigh what happened with the ex ?
Can you tell me what genre it is? (action, comedy, drama, etc)? It is undoubtedly a comedy. Have you heard of it? No, I haven't. Can you tell me a little more about it?
how may kids do you have ? my kids are going to be the death of me . y kids drive me nuts . i have 17 my wife is smart and we have so much money but the kids . 17 kids , wow .
It got reviews too. It has a 8/10 on rotten tomatoes. Yes it was good for it's time. I liked Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow. I am glad that the same trillion celebrities get to continue to make trillions of dollars pretending to be people. They deserve it because they were built with the correct bodies and we are stupid slaves. These people would never take 2 minutes out of their day to watch me do something but I need to watch everything they do for eternity. Thats so impressive for a superhero film! In a way you are correct, but they got to that point because they are all incredible actores The Iron Man was a real teamplayer and im happy they wrote the film in that direction Yes, it had nothing to do with any other factors. There are people curing diseases, but people who pretend to be other people make 1000x more money than them because they try harder than scientists. When Walt Disney bought this Franchise I knew great things would come about from it Yes good thing they keep using resources on these movies while people starve to death. I liked the beginning when Loki encountered the Other.
i wish that was possible . maybe you could play one on tv hat would be so cool . maybe one day .
well i live on the coast and i love driving my old stingray down the sea side .
It was a pretty safe movie overall, just like the review said. Well good conversation. Have a good day!
Yes. still remember that he put on the batman outfit and jumped. You really feel his frustration against the corruption of Gotham when he wants to take out Joe Chill after the trial, but Falcone's men take him out instead. I did not remember, but you can tell more. It was at the beginning, he wants to kill his parent's murderer, but the crime boss' men take him out first. Then he leaves Gotham to go train with Liam Neeson and the League of Shadows off in Tibet or wheerever. Then he learns they want to destroy Gotham because it's too far gone and he burns down the place, but saves Neeson as Ra's al Ghul dies in the fire. Ok. Need to see the movie again. Haha, there's a lot of details you can miss. Ok. It's after that he comes back to Gotham and becomes Batman. Where Scarecrow first surfaces and uses his fear gas on him Then you find out the League of Shadows was using Scarecrow to gas Gotham into oblivion and watch the city tear itself apart.

I agree. The rotten tomatoes score is 96%. All of the major rating sites gave it great reviews.  I really enjoyed the acting and directing thought it was very well done. I liked Justin Timberlake as Sean Parker. I can't believe it came out 8 years ago, though. Yes he great!  I know it is hard to believe that facebook is that old. "The biographical parts take liberties with its subject." I remember there was some controversy about how accurate the movie was, but it was still entertaining! Right, we would like the movies we see to be accurate to the original story but the ones making the movie want it to be entertaining. It's definitely a balance. Do you typically choose movies based on the rating? I always look the ratings to see, but I also try to get feedback from people that have seen it that have the same taste in movies as me I forgot about the part where he creates  Facemash. That was pretty messed up, but, then again, we basically have the same concept on Tinder. Yes it was pretty awful for him to do that, but like you said we have that with Tinder and all the apps like it.  It has become the social norm now. Based on just the movie, do you think he "stole" the concept and owed money to the brothers? Well it is a similar concept, all major inventions or concepts have taken aspects of some other idea from someone else. He probably should have compensated them for what they showed him but he didnt owe them Yeah, I agree. I think they had a settlement in the end, but it was more like a slap on the wrist. Facebook is crazy huge now. Yeah zuckerberg is one of the youngest and richest men in the world
ood luck on that . no more marriage i will adopt a beagle instead .
yes , i am good . but friends in fl are going to have a hard time . i grew up on the west coast right near the ocean . i cannot imagine a hurricane spent 20 years in n . cal . 5 years in fl and now in nyc area ice we travel a lot . staying in texas for a while now i think what part of tx ? not houston . much farther north . there is entirely too much texas but do not tell anyone i said that right . i agree , but like austin ustin is the portland of now . i love it .
Cool, yea I am a huge fan of the way the Marvel movies have been handled, especially the Avengers. Marvel Studios and WAlt Disney definitely have done the movies justice For sure.  Do you know what S.H.I.E.L.D. stands for by chance? I did when i was younger but not anymore Haha, got ya. Loki is a great casting choice What was your favorite casting choice from the movie? Also have you seen more from JOss Whedon? Definitely one of them.  I don't know the actor's name, but he was the perfect amount of creepy for that role. I dont't think I can recall any other Joss Whedon flicks off the top of my head. He was the creator of Buffy the Vampire Slayer Oh I see I love the scenes with the Tesseract opening up the wormhole.  The CGI was amazing in this movie Yes, the CGI has been amazing in all of the avengers movies Also having Scarlett Johansson play the Black Widow with all her action work was great Especially with the Hulk transformations I can't wait for her movie to come out Oh, yea Scarlett was amazing. Yes the transformations were great I agree, I am looking forward to it as well. I thought that NYC was the perfect location for the battle I was just going to say that Such an American icon, and so recognizable for pretty much all Americans yes, worldwide Indeed Does Thor have the ability to control minds like Loki does? no I didn't think so. he has the hammer and super strength and military strategy Got ya, he would be unstoppable if he had the mind control too
being born in june does not count so i have none
i like that too . where do you live ? in georgia . very beautiful here right now .

Neither did I. they think there will be a Broadway musical about it, do you believe it will make it there? I hope it does. I mean isn't it one of Disney's most successful movies, correct me if I am wrong? I think it is, and I know my kids loved it Yep me too and I am a grown man. No shame in that. Do you think they will make a Frozen 2? I hope they do just hard to think what it could be about though as they closed off all avenues True which was your favorite charicter character Olaf The snowman guy How about you? haha mine was Sven Oh haha he is a close second for me too Wow did you know Ana was sung by 4 different people Nope I never knew. When Ana is singing the wanna build a snow man song, they used 4 people ranging in ages for the song as shegrew up Oh interesting. I think that is understandable as the singers wouldn't be able to alter their voices to sound younger/older, but its surprising to know because I never thought of that i hated Hans though wanted to punch him Haha Same it made something brew in me I didn't know the directors of frozen also did Rotten Tomatoes What do you mean they did Rotten Tomatoes? He directed it Wait he owns rotten tomatoes?

Hi are you ready to start I am. Are you? Yes You can start if you don't mind Do you like Thriller Movies Yes! I love them! I try not to watch them alone. What are your thoughts on Jaws? I enjoyed it. I think that the rating is a little high though. What do you think? I thought the rating was above average for this movie. The shark image looked animated to me. I guess it was the year it was put out. However I will no be getting in the ocean because I am deathly afraid of sharks. that's what I was thinking too. One of the responses says "likely to turn the stomach of the impressionable" I guess comparing it to movies now that is crazy, but at that time that was cutting edge I don't get deep in the ocean, just up to my thighs. Yes, scared me into not wanting to get in the ocean or on a boat.  I do agree thats its gruesome for children. Jaws was a movie I grew up with. Probably the first horror film I watched.

Have you seen the movie? No I have not.  I don't think I would be interested. Why? Not my type of movie; However the reviews are good and you should probably see it if you like those types of movies. I'm not certain.  Is there romance, too?
so she is a teacher , that is interesting . i have thought of teaching a cooking class .
okay . that sounds like a plan . ursings great . our scrubs are blue , which i love and it paid off my house i thought about nursing years ago . do you work 12 hour shifts ?

oh . . now . . ? please go ahead . .
well most women say they are out of my league ry downloading tinder or something man . no need to hit on random girls .
Yes definitely. It almost feels like you are in the movie with them. I especially loved one of the scenes in the middle where they are fighting and it seems like they hate each other but they end up kissing. It feels very realastic. Is there any foul language or sex in the movie? What is the rating? There are some sensitive scenes and mild foul language, but nothing that would be more than a PG 13 rating. So would you recommend a teenager watch this movie if I took my daughter to it? Every teen is different but i personally saw this movie when i was a teenager and i still love this movie to this day. The romance between the two main characters Noah and Allie is such a classic love story. Was there any religious theme to the movie regarding God or morality? No there isn't much regarding religion in this movie. It is more of the "wrong kid from the wrong tracks" falls in love with a wealthy girl and her parents doesn't approve of the match, but that doesn't stop their love story from unfolding. Did they have any children together in this movie?
sometimes , i am on a diet . what is your favorite food ? i absolutely love , love spaghetti . pasta is always delicious , i love driving in the rain i do not get out much , always sitting on couch . we should hangout sometime anyway ! cool idea , what state do you live in ? i live in california , best for being a lifeguard ! i also love the beach .
hahah . i bet ! its not all that fun do you have a favorite animal ?
hey died in a car wreck when i was five
Have you seen the movie? I have but it's been about 30 years I have. Critics said it was a scary thriller that worked because it was populated with characters who evolved into human beings Perhaps you have a question or ten I could answer. Easy questions, and then you can decide whether to watch it or no? The only thing I remember was the scene with the shark circling this boat and two men on the boat, then suddenly it like jumps on top. Who is the old man character, do you know? I know he's famous but I can't remember his name. You should also remeber the opening scene that takes place ata party on Amity Island, on the beach he was played by Robert Shaw I would have to see it again. It's been so many years. Were there any young people who got famous from the movie? I believe Richardy Dryfuss went on to become a beloved star of screen after this role, and probably before it. Oh yes I know him!  When did the movie come out? I know I was a child. This movie came out in 1975, I would have been six!  Do you know who directed it? It was directed by Stephen Speilberg Wow. He has done a lot. I wish I could think of more questions. lol There must have been some pretty girl. There's always a pretty girl. Know any actresses from the movie? Lorrain grey was sheriff brody's wife. perhaps you'd like to know genera or key scenes from the movie? Yes tell me about the first kill! A young woman is violently pulled under the water. Were any children killed by the shark?
The classic status tend to only appear after a while while the movie is seen cold, it isn't the first movie that isn't well liked by the critics at the moment that they come out. Do you think it was fair that Kevin's mom punished him by sending him to the third floor/attic because he was fighting with his siblings? Not particularly but given the size of the family it might be necessary for the sake of peace. Yeah but I always felt bad for Kevin since he was the youngest and the smallest yea, me too But the bullied little kid was an staple of the 90's cinema Sometimes they overplayed their hand Yeah I suppose. Although on the other hand the whole movie was about him learning responsibility and how to get along with his siblings better I thought it was always funny that his dad didn't seem to care too much
i do not know . i wish i became a whale trainer . . like at sea world . . . wishful thinking
ot particularly . forces me to eat fast food , which i hate . i have to go somewhere new once a year hat is pretty exciting . i do like to fish in new places .

That's also a great film. The genre of this movie is also one of my favorites. Did you have a favorite scene? My favorite scene was when the creature was revealed. What was yours? I liked the sequence where the bathroom got flooded. Thought that was pretty creative. I agree, I think the whole movie was very creative. I think it requires a lot of thought and imagination to think of a plot like this. Yes, I agree. What other movies of this genre did you like? I like other Benecio Del Toro dramas. He's a great actor, don' **don't you think? Sorry, Guillermo del Toro I dont know too many other movies that he did besides Pan's Labyrinth That one was pretty weird as well. Most of his movies are really weird. He's always rated pretty well too. His ratings for this movie were really high. Speaking of weird, what did you think of the scene where the creature heals the character in the canal? Yeah I thought that was weird as well. Like can he heal or what? He somehow also gave her gills. I just found out that he also did Hellboy So yeah he does all weird movies. He must have a really fertile mind to be able to think of all these bizarre fantasy movies.... Healing a person and giving them gills... crazy stuff Yeah definitely He directed it.. did he write this movie as well?

I'm pretty good. Seems like you have the document this time. Do you have a movie you'd like to talk about? So the movie is How to Train Your Dragon, have you seen this before? I haven't but I've heard good things about it! What's it about? Well let see, It came out in 2010 and was produced by Dreamworks, it is a fully animated show. Dreamworks huh? I do enjoy a lot of their movies. I assume from the title that it has something to do with dragons? It is set back in the Viking Days, and it has a teenage character named Hiccup, who finds a wounded dragon and befiends it. befriends Oh the old boy and his dog story but with a dragon huh? That sounds pretty interesting. Was it received pretty well? The movie is a bit unique as it uses 3D animation , its a coming of age comedy, the same producers of Lilo and Stitch created it. It seemed to do ok it got a 98% on rotten tomatoes, but an A in Cinema score I see! That sounds pretty good then. You said it was animated but do you know who provides the voices? Actually some well known names come to mind, like hiccup is played by Jay Baruchel. And Gerard Butler as the chief Viking, America Ferrera plays a friend of Hiccup. Hiccup is the main character of course. That's really cool. I'm sure they do a great job. I really like animated movies so I might have to check that one out sometime. I have actually seen it and I would recommend it
This sounds like  great movie! Did it win any awards? Sandra Bullock delivers a strong performance as Leigh Anne, his adoptive mother. Love Sandra Bullock! Does he have siblings? It has a 69% score on Rotten Tomatoes and A+ on Cinema Score Not bad ratings at all! Would you recommend the movie? Yes, he has an adoptive brother named Sean Jr. Micheal befriended him and that's how he met the rest of the Touhy family, which ends up adopting him Is everyone the same race within the adoption? I would totally recommend this movie. It has great source material from the life of Michael Oher and great perfromances What do you find most interesting on movies?

sounds great it has a rating of A- from Cinemascore, which is pretty good, and 96% on rotten tomatoes, which is super good who's in it Leonardo DiCaprio is the star, but there's also Tom Hanks strong cast wow sounds great what are some key scenes the whole thing starts because he runs away from home as a teenager after his father has some money issues and his mother has an affair crazy when does it take place in 1963 wow what else happens his first big scam is pretending to be a pilot, and he ends up stealing over $2.8 million in forged payroll checks pretty impressive, especially considering the value of that money back then crazy and he's just a kid right? he eventually turns himself in and gets 12 years in prison but then the FBI realizes he's so good at forgery that they hire him, and he can serve out his sentence in their service instead wow and thats all true? it's "based on" a real story, but i'm not sure how much is embellishment wow. any more facts? it looks like he stayed in the business of catching forgers why does he turn himself in? i can't really tell based on the info i have. it happens after his father died, so maybe he's just so grief-stricken that he gives up? have you seen the movie? i have not do you think you might? yes defianetly User 2 has left the chat?

It's an animated comedy targeted at children, but based upon the 81% Rotten Tomatoes score adults have enjoyed it too. What genre would you say it fits into?  Comedy? Who are the lead voice actors or actresses? It features a supervillain Gru, although he refers to himself as Despicable Me, Gru's archenemy, Victor "Vector" Perkins and an elderly man in the employ of Gru, the friendly scientist. The movie is definitely a comedy. Steve Carell is the voice actor for Gru, Jason Segel voices Victor Perkins, and Russell Brand voices Dr. Nefario (the aforementioned friendly scientist). Have you watched this movie?
yeah maybe i will keep spending instead you are very funny , you know .
y dog tiki snuck some . do you have a dog ? o , but i do like to go running . do you run with your dog ? o , but i walk with my kindergartners at recess . cool , i bet that is no fun in the winter .

Okay. I'm not familiar with them. The music is really good also Okay, nice It is considered to be a dramatic romance movie Sounds interesting, I must say. I like Rachel McAdams in this but also loved her in Mean Girls Nice. You said the name of the movie was Notebook- I wonder why that name? Any idea? Well the movie is about them meeting at a carnival and falling in love and having a summer love affair. Her parents were rich and did not want him with her so maybe she wrote about it in a notebook I think it is a different name for a movie Oh, okay, Names matter to me in movies. They have to flow.
i drive really fast cars for a living . out ! my clothes are purple too . ever heard of reddit ? yes i used up all my credit cards there . racer huh ? if you need any insurance ? call me okay ? sure i call my ex boyfriend every year for his birthday . really ? did you know can patch rat holes with credit cards ? you can . y ideal of a perfect person is cher on clueless . is he stil your ex ? i get lonely alone in my condo . you rent or own ?
I'm impressed that it was Illumination Entertainment's debut film yeah Also, the movie definitely launched Pharrell into the spotlight with his music. true Jason Segel is good too definitely I think it's funny that his rival's name is Vector And that he wants to steal the moon. That's something that I can't relate too, but is funny in the movie cute joke And the movie relates to parents, kids, and adults. Pretty hard to do that! yeah impressive the Animation is good I love how he takes the girls to a theme park and think's he's going to abandon them. then he ends up "falling" for them. And when they give him their piggy banks, so adorable hehe Although, Dr. Nefario makes me mad! How could he return the girls? villain that turns out to be good hearted which is partly why the movie is so good, it's a twist yeah it is good I love how once Vector takes the moon to his ship, the moon starts to expand! What a cool idea And it's funny that Gru succeeds, at least for a little while, in shrinking the moon
I really should sit and watch it. I feel like I've missed something by not seeing it. Yes she has told me what it's about. I don't remember too much but I think it's a cute story. Have you ever heard of the original Hans Christian Andersen story? they save their country from a bitter cold season - which we all can relate to. Yes, we can relate. I didn't realize the lyricist, Howard Ashman died. Wow I didn't know that either.  The songs became very familiar to little people singing them all over the place. Yeah, I couldn't get away from it! Haha! I like how the female characters are strong. That's a good thing for our daughters to see. Elsa was kind of like the villian but she was just confused which many little people can be. I love a disney movie with a lesson learned so strategies is the next topic - The movie was rated high Me too! I learned so many lessons from Disney as a kid!
Britain so he is british Would you say that this would be a good movie to watch in the theaters or at home? I watch it at home but it is up to you. I definitely recommend it if you like historical movie Would you describe the film being as something that is an original idea? Or very similar to other WW2 movies? It is original, never seen anything like it before. It is both thrilling since they are trying to hide what they are doing to the authorities and touching since it is about being gay also at that period of time Thank you! Hope you watch it. Great! Well thank you for the recommendation. I will probably watch it soon on amazon! Thank you!
I do like that the women seemed to take the lead. What do you think of the sister? Anna with red hair?! Very sweet and innocent, a striking contrast to her sister who is always gloomy and dramatic-they are like fire and ice! Elsa is very dramatic.  I thought the casting was perfect.

oh that's right... I think this last scene was less memorable than the others...  The best part of this movie was the setup and all the character development.  Almost didn't matter how it ended. I definitely agree with you, although I don't want to. When I think back to the movie, I hardly remember that scene.
Tony escapes by building a metal suit out of scrap while also pretending to build a missile for the terrorist group. The metal suit is his prototypical Iron Man suit.

hi Hi! Have you seen the movie, La la land? NO what about you Its oscar movie right? Yes, I have. It is a romantic musical, very funny, too. I highly recommend it to you. :) Yeah I knew it a fantastic movie.. but dint make a chance to watch it I hope its a wonderful romantic film You should try to watch it if you can. It is also highly rated on Rotten Tomatoes. :) what did u like about the film Hope all the success of film goes to the Director Damien Chazelle It's a very cute movie and very aspiring. You know, an actress and a jazz pianist pursuiting their dreams in LA and fell in love. I hope so, too. He did a great job directing the movie. I think all in the film acted well. So that only It have got the oscar I love Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling. They were great in the movie as well! Hi, you still there? Yes both are perfect in their acting and attracted everyone by their act. Tell me more about the film Yes. Ryan Gosling was the jazz pianist, Sebastian, and Emma Stone was the actress, Mia. Thats nice to hear. I will surely watch this movie. what are the crucial part in the film? R u there? They met at a party and Mia tried to annoy him by requesting a song he disliked. However, that also sparked some chemistry between them. Then the story began from there. :) They also tried to encourage each other to pursuit their dreams. Hi You there? Apparently Sebastian didn't like his role in the band and Mia failed lots auditions as well. So sad. Good thing they had each other. Hello? Are you around?

I heard they are making a second movie to follow Frozen It only got an 89 percent on rotten tomatoes. I thought it would get a higher score. I don't much care for review sites, I would rather watch a movie and judge it myself. I agree with the CinemaScore of A+ Me too, I love the artwork and time that goes into animation and C.G. movies It seems like this movie just came out. I cannot believe it was 2013 when it arrived in theaters.
Thats good. I think I will watch it. Is the joker in batman begins?

Hello Have you see this movie? It has 91% Rotten tomatoes...which is pretty high. Yes, I did, I liked it a lot, and it does seem to have pretty good ratings Yes, I love Benedict Cumberbatch. He was perfect for the part! I can see it also has a CinemaScore of A+ which is pretty good And yeah, he is a great actor who else did you like Yeah, this movie deserves it. Very interesting movie. Keira Knightly was also in this movie...she's okay. I also liked her, and liked Matthew Goode as Hugh Alexander Thought his role was  vital to the movie I agree. So this really happened in 1951? Did you like Tom Goodman? Who did he play? He played Sgt. Staehl
There are a few- it gets a 92% rotten tomatoes score, a 94/100 metacritic score and a cinemascore of A- Wow, that's actually pretty good scores! Can you tell me if there's anything that makes this movie unique from other war films? Sure.  It shows a moment in time as experienced by several people at Dunkirk Is there anything else that makes it unique? It was shot on 65mm large film stock format so it's a big, enveloping movie, beautifully shot. There is sparse dialogue and it depends on its visual splendor Is there anything else you can tell me about it? Possibly things that I wouldn't like about the movie? As a war film it has violence and death and its melacholy But thats also the strength of it.  It shows whats real in war time How long is the movie? 106 mintes Is it still in theaters? I dont think so. Oh okay. I think you would like it.  Its probably available to rent or stream.  It might even be rereleased.  Its really a well done film Does it interest you?

How dumb can Losef be, taking Johns stolen car to the chop shop run by Aurelio, he recognized the car right off the bat. It is action all the way through.  The story line is what kept my attention.  You want him to get revenge. yes what is he getting the revenge for   as like what happend to him to make him that way I also like Ms. Perkins, she is the female contract killer in the underworld of assassins and knows John. she is fine He has a run in with the Russian Crime Syndicate. He is seeking revenge for the theft of his car and the killing of his puppy his late wife gave to him. seems familar i think i have seen this one ah yes
yes i am an awesome baker . i also can hunt my food . i love buffalo
we are not fond of green tea . does coke go well with it ?
I can't believe it was all the way back in 2002. I feel old now. Normally I'm not into Biographies, but this was a great movie lol! Me too!!! It was. I think at the time I watched it because of Leonardo DiCaprio? Lol I though DiCaprio did a great job acting in this movie. He did. I was pretty impressed but I think Tom Hanks ended up being my favorite character. Yeah, he is probably the only reason I watched it I can't believe that he did all of that before he was 21 years old I don't think I've ever bothered to notice the Rotten Tomatoes score of this movie before. Clearly it's been a while since I've seen it! Can you imagine! Stealing nearly 2.8 million dollars! Yeah, it has been years for me too I know! It was crazy but I also kind of found the different things he did pretty intriguing. Right! I think his time as a doctor might've been my personal favorite. II forgot that he got to work with the FBI
I do not.  In fact, I was surprised to see that.  I was equally surprised to see it was written by Tina Fey.

Very much so! I never knew this, but according to the info I have here, it was executive-produced by Steve Jobs. Interesting, I'm not sure about that. But the director was John Lasseter. Yeah. I don't know if John went on to direct the following Toy Story movies, but he did an incredible job with this one. He really did. Did you know that Andy, to boy who owns the toys, last name was Davis?

What part of childrens toys knowing how to talk and developing a relatioinship with a new toy who doesnt think he is a toy wasn't entertaining was it the whole concept or did you just not like the actors Tim Allen and Tom Hanks were so charming as Woody and Buzz Lightyear I thought they had bad performances. Not funny at all. Wow Why did you like it? even the scene where the green army men are spying on the birthday party and the piggy bank knocks the battery out of the baby monitor and the toys panic not knowing if one of them is going to be replaced Well when I was a kid it was a dream come true to think my toys might come to life when Im not in the room. That's just a dream. I mean an actual characteristic of the movie. Well overall it was a charming buddy comedy featuring two mismatched characters road tripping through a small town in order to get home featuring obstacles only a toy could face such as dogs and claw machines how do you feel about woody? He started out as a bit of a selfish jerk and ended up growing to be mroe of a selfless character at the end taking risks he would never have taken at the start. I think the character is annoying Well I guess his voice can be annoying If you hate Tom Hanks Yea, he's not good for comedy you know he started his career in comedy right and was a prolific comedic actor in the 90's doesn't mean he was good at it. In my opinion of course. what was your favorite scene? My Favorite scenew was the end where they light the rocket and buzz lgihtyear finally "flys That was ok i guess
ice i live in new york city , so i know all about shopping i went shopping online and got a purse

Exactly. Jonah Hill at his absolute best What about DiCaprio? I think he should've won the Oscar. Very likeable, but made you hate the character. Takes talent that Did you see this movie? Yeah I saw it in theatres and proably a dozen times since. One of my favourites

I never really noticed but I do think the second part of that review is funny.. because while they're trying to teach kids not to stereotype and that's admirable, they also chose such a poor subject to not stereotype because animals can't help but follow their natural instinct.
did u like it ? not particularly has a rotten tomatoes of 78% is suppose to be a dark comedy yes some parts were good but there was a lot of drug use i know did you like it? did u remember the part were they are on a plain? doing drugs no not really? what happened? it was like a big party inside the plain were there a lot of people there

You should watch the movie Maleficent, it has Angelina Jolie! W== I'd like to watch the movie...what is it about? Its a dark fantasy film and it destroys stereotypes that were only briefly touched on in the movie Frozen That sounds interesting and I liked the movie Frozen.

The Cinematography was awesome. They take a missle through a wormhole and destroy the alien ship Tony Stark did it. The Avengers become divided, due to approach Loki and the revelation thatS.H.I.E.L.D.

He builds a machine like robot correct? yeah its like a mech that can fly all based on an arch reactor that keeps his heart alive its pretty cool Marvel never stops to amaze me. yeah and this is the first one that started it all its fun to look back on it all It is. Who directed this film? jon favreau also an actor but good director as well Very talented man. yes he is he just did the newest jungle book movie as well Not surprised. What was the Rotten Tomatoes review for the Iron Man film? I am not sure of the score but it was pretty solid across the board some people did not like all of the characters but did like the movie overall Who was Tony Stark captured by and forced to work in the cave? it was an organization called the 12 rings it means more in the comics but they never went all the way with in this movie When Tony Stark was flying back to the U.S from Afghanistan, what shot him down? I believe it was one of his own weapons I am not sure, its been awhile since I have seen it How bad of a group were the Ten Rings? extremely they were isis in the comics pretty much before the real isis Do you typically enjoy super hero films? i love them I am not sure I have seen a marvel one in this universe that I did not like what about you They are difficult to understand if you have not read the comics I guess sometimes they dont follow the comics always but I get it Who were the agents in Iron Man? they were from shield you dont know they are shield until the very end though they were the ones who connected the very first movies is this universe

It has a good cast.  Ryan Gosling is a good actor as well as Emma Stone. I have heard of those actors before. Then the comments must be pretty good about the movie People are bragging on the movie saying it is a great romantic comedy.  They say it's very touching as well.

how many people has he killed You never find that out, but he was able to retire because he pulled off an "impossible task" given to him by his boss, which included many assassinations. wow. sounds intense. what is his goal in this movie also, rotten tomatoes is unreliable, what was its IMDB rating Well, the movie starts off with you finding out that his wife recently died.  Before she passed, she bought him a puppy. puppy? what breed Not sure what the imdb score is, but the Metacritic score is 68/100 and the CinemaScore is a B. what breed of puppy is it I forget what breed, but anyway a member of the Russian syndicate steals John's car and kills the puppy in an act of rage. wow is this movie really violent?

One critic said it was the best animated movie to come out since the death of Howard Ashman. Another one says that it lags on the way to the ending. I did not know that the movie came out in 3D. It would be interesting to see Elsa throwing Ice at me in 3D. Scary Yes. I like that they made a 3D movie. I had not seen one in a while. My favorite character was the reindeer Did you know there was a Broadway musical? Yes. I would like to see how they portray the scene when Elsa hurts Anna. Do you feel that Frozen was better than the Little Mermaid? I don't know about that but did you know that it is inspired by Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tail called "the snow queen" No. I did not know that. It seems to have gotten and A+ on CinemaScore. Also 89% on Rotten tomatoes. I thought it might be higher than that It was even worse on Metacritics. They gave it a 74/100. Interesting. It was interesting that Elsa remained distant from Anna even through the coronation. Elsa was hurt and did not feel so well. She accidentally unleashed her powers before the court. Yes. I am pretty sure she did unleash her powers at that time. She was terrified about the people finding out about her powers. The worst moment is when everyone is there to see her and to witness the coronation. I think they classified the movie as a comedy but I felt it was a drama. It was comedic when the marshmallow monster chased olaf off a cliff I can see how that would be quite funny. Lol. It was also dramatic when Anna goes to Hans, but rather than kissing her, he reveals that he has been plotting to seize the throne. He didn't really love her Yes. I think there were many funny moments as well as many dramatic moments. It really hit the bliss point

Really Q Why It has a 96% on Rotten Tomatoes and has Tom Hanks as well as Amy adams in it Oh It is directed by Speilburg Ok
what is your favorite food ?
yes we sure do lol
That's interesting, I love comedy! What kind of humor does it employ? Is it mostly jokes? It's more of pranks happening. See when the boy gets left alone he was fine with it until some people tried to break into his house. So in order to get them to leave he pranked them Is this a movie you can watch with the whole family? Yes for sure Does it include violence though? It's an older movie but it is great for laughs. There is a little violence but only things like falling down stairs, No guns are anything of that sort. That sounds good. Now that you mention that it's an old movie, do you think the movie is still enjoyable for present-day viewers?

Me either I like Hugh Jackman though It sounds like it would be interesting Yeah, I do too He is a good actor the key scene sounds crazy do you agree with the ratings of this movie? robotic boxers An A rating? No way! I think Rotten Tomatoes gave it like 49% favorable Wonder how he pays off the debt? Well, I can see that It doesn't seem like a real thrill seeking/ attention grabbing film

Well do you like Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hanks and Christopher Walken? All great actors! Of course. Exactly. So they make up the main characters with Leo as the lead playing Frank Abagnale Jr. Whos that? Apparently the movie is based on Frank's life who was a crazy con man. Oooh interesting. I love those types of movies. Tell me more about the role of Tom Hanks and Walken too! Before he was 19 he had gotten away with millions of dollars worth of fraud and posed as a pilot, a doctor and a lawyer Damn. That's a very interesting plot. I think I want to be him right now haha. How about the other roles? He was forced to start scamming after his dad (Walken) split up with his mom and he runs away Ohh okay, any major plot holes in the movie you would like to point out? Not yet haha. Except that I will say this kind of scam would never work in a post 911 world. The movie did get 96% on rotten tomatoes and is a Spielberg flick Thats impressive! I would definitely check that movie out. Now I am very interested haha,
i always go to expensive ones too because my parents pay my house rent
I thought the Hopps character is really cute I think the it's informative on the film and characters What do you like about Hopps? She doesn't give up. She a tough character Do you agree with the critics? From what I know about the film, which is only the information provided, I would say yes I agree] Do you? I agree with them as well do you like watching animated films like this one? I do, but I haven't watched too many recently. What about you? Yes I do. Did you love Judy's adorable carrot pen? I thought it was so cute who knew it could record too I know, that was very interesting and in turn, very helpful for her Were there any other characters you really enjoyed from the film? I like all the characters. They selected great actors to voice them who's your favorite character? I think Judy has to be my favorite Is she your favorite as well? oh yes she is Is there a character you dislike? can't say there is I feel the same what's your favorite scene in the movie? Key Scene Number 3 sounds the best What is yours? i enjoyed the scene with the carrot pen my document has disappeared.. It disappeared? Mine has not, that is very odd Does that mean that is the end of our conversation or do you believe there is a technical issue?
beaches are nice too . i was planning a vacation to miami before the hurricane . yeah that was a bummer
Hello there. The movie we are discussing is Zootopia Hi!  What is Zootopia about? Zootopia is about anthropomorphic mammals, especially a rabbit named Judy Hopps. She was an academy valedictorian when becoming a police officer but she has problems becoming an actual police officer. For example, she was put on parking duty by her chief who didn't see her potential. Who is Judy played by? Judy is played by Ginnifer Goodwin. Who else is in the movie? Jason Baterman plays a small-time con artist, fox named Nick Wilde. Idris Elba plays the police chief. And Jenny Slate plays a sheep who is the assistant meyor of Zootopia Oh cool.  Did the movie get good reviews? It got a 98 98% on rotten tomatoes Oh that's good.  What kind of movie is it?  A comedy? Yes it is a comedy. Is it animated? It is! The animation has been described as "sumptuously state-of-the-art" Cool.  What year did it come out? It is fairly recent. It came out in 2016 What was a major scene in the movie? A major scene in the movie would probably be when they find all of the animals, that have gone savage, at the Cliffside Asylum. They find out that the mayor, Mayor Loinheart, hides them from the public while a scientist tries to find out the cause. This causes Bellweather, the sheep, to become mayor. Oh cool, that sounds exciting.  Is this a movie for kids? This movie has a thoughtful message to it that I think is good for all ages. Do you know what it is rated? Maybe you could check online but it is "fast and funny enough to keep younger viewers entertained" Okay great.  Were there any negative reviews?

But from what I understand it has a great lesson about not judging people and stereotypes. THat is a very good lesson for everyone to learn Officer Judy Hopps is Ginnifer Goodwin. Oh, I enjoy her other works. I'm sure she did a good job here too. Are there other main characters? Jason Bateman is Nick, the con fox. Do they provide his backstory as to why he's a con? Idris Elba and Jenny Slate are also in it. I'm not familiar with them. Neither am I. Perhaps it will be their big break He was bullied as a kid and and stereotyped for being a con because he was a fox. Ah, so it plays into the stereotype theme. Do you know what studio produces this film? In the end Judy and Nick get close, and she asks him to join her as her partner. For work. What a wonderful happy ending Does that mean she is a full cop? Bryon Howard and  Rich Moore directed the movie.
y hey ! hows is going ? its going good and what about you ? reat , my boss asked me out , so hopefully we will be doing something entertaining . your going to date your own boss ? o know him first , you know . it is a little weird that he is my boss hat cool , i hope thing work out so it not weird at work . yeah me to , he is only 2 years older than me , i remember him from highschool oh so you where friends before he was your boss ? well , we knew each other , but never really talked . . . h well i guess it be less weird anyways . do you like video games ? re and there , do not have too much time , being a real estate agent and all

No I haven't.  I would like to though. It was made in 2014 apparently. I haven't seen it either. Do you know who starred in it? Have you seen it? Actually no.  I do not know who starred in it. Keanu Reeves apparently. I'm not a fan of his. I like him.  What is movie about? Just like the reviews say, "deadpan" is his acting style. But the story may demand that. That's how he always acts. And the review states that it didn't work here because it wasn't what the story calls for. Anyway, do you know the director? Chad Stahelski? Then why is he here? I am not sure.  What else has he done?
SO DID YOU LIKE THIS MOVIE?
Yes sounds like a whale of a time! I'll the tickets! I'll grab the popcorn! Ok Tell me more? Maybe sequels? Possibly prequels? During the movie the team becomes divided during disputes on how to resolve the situation with Loki and the fact that the agency S.H.I.E.L.D. that united the avengers plans on harnessing the power of the Tesseract to develop weapons. Wow, Loki sounds like a real treat to watch on the silver screen. Describe his hair. During one dispute the Hulk went on a rampage on a helicarrier breaking loki's inprisonment, allowing him to gain access of the tesseract and open a wormhole, launching his invasion.

I never get to see my city in anything.

Yes, he is so great. Tony Stark plays a great role in it Also, his buddy James Rhodes in the movie is played by Terrance Howard. It got really good reviews as well. yeah rotten tomatoes gave it 94% so you know it has to be good it is a good origin story too Yes. Gwyneth Paltrow plays Pepper Potts in it as well. She is gorgeous. the studios really messed up with Hulk and Spiderman so was good to see that one got right I like stark and his head of security, cant remember his name but they play off each other really well Jeff Bridges as the main bad guy Obadiah i thought was interesting but he played the double cross well

Yes I have! Have you? I have! I might need to see it again since the plot is complex. Me too I only remember bits and pieces It's quite stressful but very good. I know that they go into the dreams of others but I don't remember why Me neither. And I think I remember there is some risk with going into other people's dreams. Right I'm surprise it only has an 80% rating *surprised That is odd. Maybe the 20% didn't like how cerebral it was. What did you think of the ending? Was he in a dream or no? I like to think that he wasn't Me too. That's more depressing, but also makes the story less interesting. True I mean more interesting Was the risk that the dreamer would forget they are dreaming? Ah, I think that's it. Cause people wouldn't want to leave the dream. I think that's what happened to his wife. Right, and then when she woke up she thought she was still dreaming And killed herself to try to wake up for real Oh yeah that's right. I forgot all that. What happened to the kids? He left them, right? He walked in on her drowning them. Oh I don't remember that I can't remember if it was a dream or not. It was in a lake or creek by their house I think. I only remember the kids from the very end when he comes back to see them I could be thinking about Shutter Island... It's been a while.

Wonderful, I have heard that is a classic! Did the excerpt refer to a particular section of the movie? Indeed it is. In fact, Cinemascore gave it a rating of A! An "A" is certainly no small feet nowadays, what makes this movie so special? As you know, it's based in the Marvel Comics character and stars Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark/Iron Man. Are you a fan of Robert? I must admit, that his earliest works were a little boring for my taste, but as he aged I found him more charming That is true. It is an expansively entertaining special effects extravaganza! Indeed. He truly nailed the part. Terrance Howard is also in the film. Are you a fan of him? Terrance Howard has always interested me. He is such a phenomenal actor, particularly his work in Empire was striking. I must wonder how he and Robert perform together. Is there good chemistry between the 2? Also not to change the topic but I must ask, you mentioned special effects earlier, would you say that the movie leans heavily on special effects, or just use them to an end In my opinion, there was. He played James "Rhodey" Rhodes - a friend of Stark' s and the liaison between Stark Industries and the US Air Force. In the beginning, they go to Afghanistan to test a missle known as "Jericho". But it all goes wrong when their convoy is ambushed and Stark is critically wounded. Interesting, I always find that the chemistry between lead and supporting characters drives plot development To answer your question, I'd say it impressively sets mechanics that combine smoothly with relatively seamless CGI! And they do! Rhodes was with stark in Afghanistan during the Jericho missile test! Well that does sound great. What age group be the most interested in this type of film

That isnt too horrible of a score. I do like black comedies. The rampant corruption Belfort's firm Stratton Oakmont goes through is legendary. I see it also has Matthew McConaughey in it. Oh, it's based on a book. Didn't know that. It does have Matthew McConaughey in it. I wonder if he's the reason for some of the critical response such as "an irresponsible glorification rather than a satirical takedown." Yes, the book is a memoir. Jordan Belfort, the real one not DiCaprio, lived the life portrayed in the movie. And based on a true story, it seems. The life of Jordan Belfort. He began his career on Wall Street, where he was introduced to the sex and drug fueled stockbroker culture. Whats your opinion of the movie so far? He has an aggressive pitching style and high commissions, making him a small fortune. Interesting. I'm always down for a Leonardo DiCaprio film. And Martin Scorsese. Yeah, McConaughey is a great actor, but can only play certain characters, IMO. I didnt realize this movie was that old. 2013. I remember wanting to watch it on Netflix, but they removed it before I could. He does have both of those things. His small fortune was won through fraud, though. Jonah Hill even makes an appearance as DiCaprio's business partner. Yes, the film did come out many years ago. Though, its still well worth going back to view. That's cool. A funny part of the movie is how Jordan creates the name for his brokerage firm. Wow, he scammed $22 million in 3 hours!
Have you seen any of the Marvel movies before? Iron man.  Is he in it? Who are the main actors? Yes!  He's in this move, along with a LOT more. RObert Downey Jr,, Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson Jeremy Renner, and many others. Woah, what a cast. Must have been a really expensive movie If it came out in 2012, are there sequels? Anytime you go to a Marvel movie, you are NEVER disappointed.  I can only give information from the data sheet I was given.  So I can't say anything about sequels. But this movie has Iron Man, Captain America, Hulk, Thor, Black Widow and Hawkeye. Hence the name The Avengers.  I wonder who the Villain must be to have a team that powerful? The team must stop Thor's brother Loki from subjugating the Earth. Seems like a very powerful being.  Do you know how long the movie is? No.  I don't have that information. Well I am interested in watching it. Thank you You are very welcome.  Do you go to the movies very often? Not really.  The only movie that made me go out in the past 5 years have been the Star Wars movies, Those are fun too.  I think I see more than most.  My step-daughter has been assistant manager at the local multi cinema at the mall for 5 years.  She is always getting us in for free. Thats a nice perk. on a 10 point scale what would you rate The Avengers? Oh, I would give it a solid 8.  I see that's about in line with Rotten Tomatoes score of 8/10.

Alright Nope I haven't When was it made? I haven't either, although I do know that it starred Robert Downey Jr. as the lead character. Ok, I actually do like him very much. maybe we should start from the year it was released It came out in 2008. 2008? that's pretty old and who directed the movie? Yes, it is. It is based on the Marvel Comics character. The director is Jon Favreau. Oh you mean it is a comedy film? No, it is in the Superhero genre. Somewhat of an action film. I see, Did you by any chance get to know who wrote the story? The screenplay was written by the writing teams of Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby and Art Marcum and Matt Holloway. Gwyneth Paltrow was also in the film. Hmm so what is the movie about ? The reviews seem to say the special effects were good. What happened to who, and who did what? Give me a second to go over the plot. Oh, what did Rotten tomatoes say about it then? Rotten Tomatoes 94 percent and average: 7.7/10 Alright Does this seem like a film you would want to see? quite okay I don't generally watch Superhero films, but this cast is good. Jeff Bridges is also in it. well maybe if I get a grasp of the plot I might be able to decide, moreover, the cast doesn't seem too familiar to me does it have any comments from critics? Robert Downey plays Tony Stark, an industrialist and inventor. He also plays the role of Iron Man.

It's all based on a true story about NFL lineman Michael Oher Sandra Bullock is in it and gives a great perfomance. She shows that she can actually act. Is it a happy movie? Also do you know how long it is? It's about her and her husband adopting a young man and them raising him while he plays high school football It's a very uplifting story That sounds good. I think I may remember having heard something about that movie. I'm not sure how long it is but I'd guess 2 hours I think a friend said that they really liked it Nice Do you know if it won any awards? It's well worth your time. Just a very good movie Awesome.

For me personally, a 143-minute film usually has to be a bit less predictable, humor notwithstanding, but I like the superheroes. Yes, anything with superheroes is a winner. I never quite got what S.H.I.E.L.D. stands for. In this film we need to protect the Tesseract before Loki can get; otherwise, he will give it to the other But he does get it and opens wormholes right and left! :-) Well, it activates and then that creates the wormhole that he travels through to get to earth. Loki is the type who is not easily satisfied... I don't know if they should use the power of the Tesseract because it could back fire.  Maybe we should just protect it. Yes, Loki doesn't understand not getting his way, I agree. Did you like how the Helicarrier appears, and the attack begins. Yeah, and it seems that the Avengers backfire against themselves with all their infighting.
well , i am happy with my current job , i am not looking to change or shift careers .

Despicable me starring Pierre coffin. Ahh, yes, that is a great movie! one of the best actors of all time I loved the animation
oh awww , you should go visit them
I can agree with that for sure. I am definitely a fan of the movie what do you think of the sequence when he's training in Buthan? Beautifully shot, and very well done, what do you think? I agree. But the plot is a bit thin. What do you think of the idea of batman becoming batman because of the fear of bats as a child? I think it is a fantastic way of overcoming fear, becoming the fear I think it's very ingenious. A sign of times and how we understand the psychologic dimension of human beings
oney o k could you earn more on other websites

I like him as an actor most of the time. From the beginning, he really makes you like Gatsby and tries to explain how good of a friend he was. And although I don't really like Di Caprio as a person, I think he often does a good job in movies. It's kind of a risky casting though - Tobey Macguire and Di Caprio together don't look like a likable pair. Agreed. The dynamic is interesting. Do you typically watch movies set in specific time periods?
it seems more violent movie what is the role of puppy in the movie is its character has an important role in the plot the russian ringleader gave john a very difficult task to achieve (assassinating many people) before he retired to marry his wife. i guess it is payback  for him for those he killed. so its a revenge story im sorry i forgot to add, the puppy was a gift from his deceased wife yes it is a revenge movie. thanks for the story conversation its fun to caht with u good bye and have a good day youre welcome. you have a good day too! are you still there? im not sure if we are done. the finish conversation button is not activated yet let abort the conversation I think it will get highlighted after that

Awesome!  No, I haven't seen it yet and I was thinking about watching it though. What is it about? Oh it's hilarious. It didn't receive a huge score on rotten tomatoes, but it had a really good cinema score. What is it about? It's about a down on his luck reporter who complains to God and is offered a chance to be God for a week. And the reporter is Jim Carrey? Yes the reporter is Jim Carrey and it also stars Jennifer Aniston as his wife and Steve Carell as the antagonist. I like Jim Carrey, he's a riot.  I don't know about Jennifer Anniston, so they had a happy marriage? He actually has a crush on his co-worker, played by Catherine Bell, so there's some conflict with his relationship with Jennifer Aniston. Oh, okay.  How does he get to be God? Does he have special powers? God is played by Morgan Freeman, and by complaining to God about his situation, Morgan Freeman offers him the opportunity to be God for a week. Yes, Bruce(Jim Carrey) does have special powers that allow him to cause miraculous events for the week he plays God. That sounds hilarious.  Morgan Freeman is so respectable. Did anyone know he was God or was it a secret? It is hilarious, he ends up causing his co-worker/antagonist, Steve Carell, to embarrass himself on live television by using his powers.
it about  trapping Allied troops on the beaches of Dunkirk. Under air and ground cover from British and French forces, troops were slowly and methodically evacuated from the beach using every serviceable naval and civilian vessel that could be found.

Oh, a classic pixar :) I have not seen it in ages. When was it released? I'm curious. It is a comedy, animation Adventure movie. And yes, a classic Pixar movie. I saw it a long time ago also Yes, I would say it is all of those things! Does it have good ratings from critics? t was released in 1995 by director Jaoh Lasseter It has a 100% by rotten tomatoes. Wow... 95! I was only 6 when it came out ha! It was definitely popular when I was little. Wow... 100! Rotten tomatoes doesn't give out 100s easily. Tom Hanks was really good as Woody. I totally agree The perfect voice for woody Was there any other big names in the movie? Tim allen played Buzz lightyear Don Rickles was perfect for Mr. Potato head. Ohhh, that's right. I forgot about Tim Allen. They were all worried about what And was getting for his birthday. Andy Ha! This is when he gets Buzz, right?

Yeah, I don't really care about their ratings. It's an interesting topic. it is, i think it is awesome that morgan freeman is God He sounds like an God. It's only right that he was God exactly, he should literally be god i think it is great that steve carell is in it too he is so funny Jim Carrey prolly trolled by being God Got all the things he wanted. Lambos and billion dollars. Cash... lol that is probably true honestly too lmao yeah exactly, you got em there lol he will pray everyday this thing says yea, dream came true i bet didn't they build an arc or somethign I have no idea hmm, whatever I know he built a cool system for the prayers, right? seems like a shiity pot tho didnt know that thats sick though

I think they would have an easier time recreating small new york sets rather than changing new york as it is almost 100 years I have never heard of Carey Mulligan, Emily foreman, or joel edgerton neither have I I recall the scene described though it has been some time ugh this sucks dude how much longer do you think? no clue I dont remember reading the book, even though I did in 8th grade
did i say beer , lol
It was pretty good. I am a fan of Leonardo anyway. So, I may be a little baised. Haha.. I totally understand. I like him well enough. Thought he was solid in this and DJANGO UNCHAINED. Django! He seriously pissed me off in that one. So, you know he was believable. LOL haha! Yeah, proof that the man can act, right? I do find it funny that a love story found its way into the plot, though There's always time for hugs and kisses I guess? :) Always time for hugs (and sometimes kisses). :D So, I can't remember how it ended. Did they get stuck in a dream or something?
s , scarves , gloves , whatever seems fun hat sounds fun . i want to learn how to make boots . i would rather go shopping for boots . i love shopping
I would say it is, it fantasy and drama. If you believe in mermaids, then you would have to believe that there can also be mermen. Apparently, a lot of critics believe in it What kind of movies do you like to watch? I like documentaries, but fantasy is ok.    Didn't this movie win an Oscar? It did win an Oscar You think I deserved it? Yes. Fantasy movies aren't the easiest to produce without the feeling that you reproducing something that has already been done. Its also take quite a bit of talent to act in water and an amphibious suit That is one way of looking at it. So, aquaman won an Oscar too? Not sure if the creature was awarded an Oscar too But I feel the movie has enough substance that it is worth watching Well, if it could win awards, that there is a lot of merit. So do they end up together? You'll have to watch and find out. I can't ruin movie. You can tell me.  For me, it is not what happens, but rather, HOW it happens So all in all its a story of forbidden love, of course they live "happily ever after"
boardwalk , i spend a lot of time in the water there . what do you do ? i am a professional gamer is there a lot of money in that ? the volunteer work i do does not pay much . here is a lot of pay in it if you are good . volunteering is noble . fter my dad died i wanted to give back so i go to nursing homes . hat is a very noble profession ot like my dad , he served and protected . . . until they got the best of him .

Hello!  How's your day? Pretty good! How is yours? Great thanks!  :)   So it looks like we'll be talking about Maleficent today, I loved this movie.  How about you? Yes, I enjoyed it. Very different from the cartoon sleeping beauty, I liked seeing her side of the story. Who was the guy who cut off her wings again?
y phone is wringing . . . gotta go . . . thanks for the chat !
of course you would . i am also a great musician . are you young ?
Yeah. I never really saw her appeal. She seems to land a lot of kindof preachy roles, and not really a great fit for Carrey, who is so rubber-faced. Maybe they were hoping she could get her fans in the seats? Very much agreed. Do you watch many of these types of slap stick comedy movies? I seem to end up watching this sort of thing at home, but I almost never pay to see it in the theater. Nine dollars is too much to gt a chuckle. Did you see it with friends or on your own? I don't seek them out, either. They're just on, and I fail to change the channel. I watched it at home as well, with friends. How do you like Steve Carell in this movie as Evan Baxter? Was he funny to you at all? I love Steve Carell. They tried to make him pretty unsympathetic, here. I guess you are supposed to root for the put upon reporter, who's clearly willing to cheat on his girlfirend, and has no work-life balance? The role can't have been that good, though. Can't remember a single piece of Evan/Carrel's dialogue.

I can just see Jim Carrey getting passed over in the movie for the promotion by his rivalry. Tom Shadyac knew just who to pick to star in this movie.
I feel like it's become as much a part of popular culture as a movie Definitely the concept of the film is great, showcase the life of dolls and action figures when the kids and parents are not watching. Thats genius Have you seen Sausage Party with Seth Rogen it has kinda the same concept just with food? yeah I love the characters they made for the toys. A lot of them are in popular culture like I was saying Sausage Party was pretty good! I didn't like the religious inferences but there were so many funny parts in it Toy Story is definitely more of a kid's movie Yea Buzz, Woody are definitely household names. I remember playing the game on PC when it came out. Toy Story is a classic and the sequels are great. I heard the 4th movie is in production one of the most popular phrases I've heard is "To infinity and Beyond!" Lmao we used to say that randomly in class all the time. My favorite was "There's a Snake in My Boat"
Yes they are.  The ice palace that Elsa created was pretty cool though. Sounds so cold. I'm sure it was I wonder who ruled the kingdom for hte time between when parents died and elsa turned 21! That's a really good question.  But then again, it's a kids movie and they don't worry about power vacuums! i love that the ice creatures name is marshmellow Haha.  It's a character worth rooting for purely because of the name. Unlike Hans Hans is the evil prince! Lucky for them all the queen escaped. I wonder how she escaped froze everything? haha I would certainly make sense turn her weakness into a strength

I think LOST was the only series I am aware of Gotcha Would you stil see this movie knowing rotten tomatoes gave it a 59/100? I havent watched that series in years Yes because rotten has rated some of thr best movies bad would you watch it? True ... one critic called the movie " Rocky with Robots" ... I did like Rocky did you see those movies? I don't think I'd watch it now, after seeing the reviews ... I liked rocky Apparently the plot is how boxers are replaced by robots ... do you think that's feasible?

It sounds like that is one of the top scenes in the movie.  Not sure I could of done something like that even if it was the right thing to do.  Would you be able to do that? I'm with you! It was probably a difficult decision for him to make.It's pretty amazing the guts things like this take, not only following the troops and documenting but then releasing those reports about the war conflict.

My favorite is "surround his audience with chaos and horror from the outset." (critical review) and a "triumph in filmaking"
Who is in it? you will love the cast - Roy Scheider as Chief Martin Brody, Robert Shaw as Quint, Richard Dreyfuss as Matt Hooper, and Lorraine Gary as Ellen Brody.  the film was also directed by award-winning director Steven Spielberg. Is this a fairly new movie? not really.  it was released in 1975.  however, the story is timeless.  it's about a giant man-eating great white shark that attacks beachgoers on Amity Island in New England. Sounds interesting. How long is it? i'm not sure about the length of the movie.  but it's so thrilling, i doubt you will be watching the clock! My kind of movie. Do you think it is okay for kids? Jaws is too gruesome for children, and likely to turn the stomach of the impressionable atany age. Cool. Definitely want to see it. Is it streaming anywhere? maybe you can check online!  make sure you check out the beach party scene at the beginning of the movie. intense?
Oh it says here he did die
Yeah it was. I know it was an F. Scott Fitzgerald book and somewhat autobiographical. Yes it was set in the roaring '20s. I love that time period. yeah I had to read it in college and it was a little tough to get all the symbolism
llo there ! how are you ? i am great ! how about you ? i am doing quite well , thank you . what do you do for fun ? i like over over analyze everything including my friends . and you ? do you find that fun ? ? i go to the movie theater once every other month . xtremely . oh , i love the movies i go with my sons . hat is fun ! i just have a dog , no kids . my husband had a dog before he passed . he loved heavy metal just like me ! i am sorry to hear about your husband ! being a single mom must be tough . some days are harder than others . what do you do for fun ? i like to decorate my new home in california , you ? what a nice place to live ! i sell makeup to bring in extra money . oh ! do you like it ?
I also like the other woman I just watched it a few weeks ago twisted but so good The reviews on this one are good all around. Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic both rated it highly, as well as Cinema Score. Are there any scenes that stuck out ot you? I liked the ending How he ended up being a God and saved her from drowning. What a twist right?! once I saw the scars on her neck I knew they were gills pieced everything together Guillermo Del Toro is a great director for sure This is just another hit of his if you ask me I agree! what was your favorite part? I knew that when Elisa started visiting the creature in secret that she was going to fall in love. I think that buildup was my favorite aspect of the movie
it is beautiful . i am a veteran and was there in the military
its 85 degrees outside where i live . what about you ? 90 ! i hate florida so much
And only a 46 from Metacritic.  Also not a great score. Jim Carrey is funny a great comedian in it Yes that score is low I thought the movie was fun One of his best films by far he is a free spirit in it What do you think of Jim Carrey His character is a funny new reporter Carrey is a great comedian, and he was great in this movie Dream My of becoming a news anchor one day Philip baker plays jack he was good too The movie was directed by Tom Shadyac.  He did a great job. Yes he did a great job Morgan freeman has such range he played god and did a good job Steve Carell is also in the movie as Jim Carrey's rival. Steve is a funny man I like him In the office better then this movie too Catherine Bell placed his second love interest in the movie, in additional to Jennifer Aniston. It’s funny when Jim Carrey takes over being god for one week Oh I didn’t realize Catherine bell wasn’t in this movie too He plays a down on his luck reporter what a change as the movie goes on

Who is your favorite character And this movie has marked the big beginning in marvel industry Iron man lol Lol Tony stark is great Yea I agree, this movie really kicked off the Marvel craze I’ve watched it atleast 8 times now Robert Downey Jr was perfect for this movie. I can't see anyone else as Iron Man
didn't think boxing was that interesting to begin with do people control the robots or are they like self aware robots that just like to box? They're actually self-aware robots trained by their owners The main robot in the movie is trained/owned by Jackman who is a former boxer himself so its mostly about him training a robot to be a boxer, im guessing like a come back story to reclaim his former glory or something, who is the director? those michael bay films are always all action and explosions but are hit or miss on the actual story Exactly and the director is shawn levy can't think i have seen any of his work who else is in the movie? Hugh Jackman as Charlie Kenton● Dakota Goyo as Max Kenton● Evangeline Lilly as Bailey Tallet● Anthony Mackie as Finn● Olga Fonda as Farra Lemkova Hugh Jackman was the only one I recognized to be honest
ya for sure

I cannot. I don't think he could relate to children. But he is very good at impersonating people. Yes, that was a very cool part.

Yeah, Donnie turned on him but it was justified. Martin Scorsese is an excellent director He deserves the accolades he gets. Are you still there?

All I'll say is it's one of Jim Carrey's best films. He plays a News reporter that hopes to become an anchor, but is seen as too comedic by his fellow workers. It's hilarious. Would you consider this a family friendly film? Well maybe if I told you a bit more of the story you might be able to determine if this might be the right fit. Okay, what was your favorite scene? Well, Bruce Nolan (Jim Carrey) is a television field reporter for Eyewitness News at WKBW-TV in Buffalo, New York, but desires to be the news anchorman. Bruce, suffers from constant bad luck. Bruce reaches a breaking point when he is passed over for promotion by his rival, Evan Baxter (Steve Carell), who then steals dialogue from an unaired segment by Bruce while accepting the promotion on air. This was my favorite scene. How large is Steve Carrell's role in the movie? Does he have a lot of scenes? I don't want to give away the entire movie all at once. But I will say I definitely recommend it. Is there any nudity or foul language I need to worry about kids seeing? You are putting me in a tight spot here. I really don't want to spoil anything. How about this: I'll say that Bruce uses hispowers to cause Evan to humiliate himself on air, causing Evan to be fired in favor of Bruce as the new anchor. But that's all you're getting out of me. Does that sound like hilarity for the whole family or what?

What did I get out of the story? Well, for me it showed me that no matter the situation in life; you never give up. That if you go for what you want in life, it is gonna take hard work and perseverance, and of course... never give up. I agree, never giving up is the main thing i also got out of it. Well, to blackmail period is wrong... but I feel as if Judy used to gain some advantage, considering her stature.
Oh wow! that is pretty cool!
Very cool. I'll have to check it out. Do you usually look up ratings before you see a movie? No. i didn't i just watch the preview That's a good idea. I've never heard of the director, Zack Snyder, before. Does Superman die? Yeah he did It was sad man Dang. I didn't see that coming at all. That sucks. Well you've convinced me to not let the ratings sway me. I'll definitely have to watch it now. You. need to because it was Epic..........

That was the other big one! Didn't he pass medical school board exams? He really was a genius. This was also a film that was unlike many of Steven Spielberg's traditional films, but works very well. Yeah, he did. He even posed as a Louisiana Parish!
otally ! i love dancing to britney spears songs !
Becareful of the reviews. I have found some movies that were very good that were poorly reviewed.  Yes, I remember Zack. Good stuff . AS far as kryptonite goes, a superman movie without it is impossible.

ll . i like those old dependable cars !
I love that it was based on Hans Christian Andersen.  I just wish that more parents knew how to relate new movies back to the classics to show their children that the classics are still relevant. Definitely. I give the movie 5 stars. I agree.  The CinemaScore was A+, and that's wonderful.  I don't think that the Metacritic score of 74/100 was high enough. Yes, definitely should have been higher. Idina Menzel was a stunning choice for Elsa, but do you think Kristen Bell was bold enough for Anna? Yes, Kristen did a great job. I enjoyed the bits of comedy in the movie. I loved the magic in it. I did have a few issues with the movie.  The concept that parents would choose to hide things from one sister, to the point of erasing her memory, is scary to children. Yes, but they can always watch the movie again when they get older and then they might understand it better. It's a great fantasy film. I also think that seeing two sisters so estranged is setting up some children for issues. Yes, but it does reflect upon real life as well as fantasy. And when a child sees that someone suppresses an issue instead of dealing with it, it's not a healthy coping mechanism True. I agree. At least she was healed though. I'm glad she tried to control her magic. I hated that Anna supposedly fell in love in one night. It was sad indeed that the parents died. Well at least she tried.
y this is joanne ! how are you today ? i am ok my allergies are killing me though bummer ! i am in my garden all time , thankful i have no allergies lucky you . . how are you doing today ? i am good . i just washed my hair and finished sewing a dress . ca not complain ! hat is awesome so do you have animals o animals , unless you count the bunnies i see in my garden ! lol , you ? yes i have a cat she is so cute

Awesome, thanks. Do you know what the main conflict is or what the characters are trying to resolve? There are at least two main topics in the movie: The first one, the conflict between Woody, the old-fashioned toy , and Buzz Lightyear, the space ranger arrived as a gift surprise, for the affections of their owner, six-year-old Andy Davis; and the second, Andy's family is moving, toys and everything, to a new home. The moving topic is prevalent through the whole movie, but in its first half it moves to the background to highlight the rivalry between Woody and Buzz; finally, when the rivalry is solved, they work together to be reunited with their owner. That sounds interesting. Does the boy, Andy, know that his toys are "alive" or have lives outside of the time he sees them? Is it part of his imagination or really happening?
ot really . i like tv more . my mom stays home and we have our shows
hello Hello! So there a movie that explores the idea of implanting ideas into your head, via a dream, in order to manipulate you into making a decision in real life. The whole concept seems way above my level of understanding haha but, definitely seems interesting. The reviews for the movie are higher than average and I general everyone thought the movie was awesome. However, there were a few who didn't enjoy the movie at all! But that's probably because they didn't understand it! Leonardo DiCaprio is In it and one critic said it was one of his best performances yet. So in the movie DiCaprio's character is tasked with going into the mind of some heir to a company and implanting the idea for him to dissolve that company. In public eye the heir already decided to make some.other business move, but the powers that be don't want that outcome and desire the company dissolved. Enter Leo DiCaprio! The heir will then be sueded to dissolve the company after Leo enters his mind through a dream, getting the desired outcome. I mean imagine if you made a Decision one minute. Took a nap and woke up and completely changed your mind and decided to do the exact opposite but it was because someone implemented the idea in your head while you slept! The whole concept is crazy, but intriguing. Makes you wonder what the dangers of it are. And then also, in the movie, it's stated that Leo's character is able to achieve this task because of a shared dream world. I wonder if the subject knows their mind is being invaded and fights back through their subconscious?! Would that be awesome to see play out in the movie!? The movie is called inception and is directed by Christopher Nolan. His Dark Knight Batman trilogies are some of my absolute favorite movies. So no wonder inception got such great reviews. There are several other great actors in the movie, Joseph Gordon Levitt and Ellen page and Tom Hardy. I really enjoyed the action sequences in the movie. It was definitely a movie you have to pay attention to in order to understand but the concept is unique and intriguing. So you think it's something you would watch? Are you still there?
i am great here in ny hat is good . i like to ride bike , do you ? yes but i like photography the best interesting . i like photography . i am a veterinarian by profession . sounds interesting . i just started at nyu
It really got to me when Maleficent and Stefan were children and then he betrayed her, I must admit.
Hah! Yeah, it's a weird interface. I think it's asking for about 15 responses from each of us before it gives an option to organically wrap things up. Oh my bad. Well I do like christan bale. His other movies are really good. What is your favorite scene in Batman Begins? I'm just, you know, taking rough beats off of these pages I'm being shown. That's the thing about the Nolan Batman movies. They're really good in most respects, and in other movies Bale does an excellent job, but his performance here is so odd. I am very interested in seeing the movie. Is there anything you hated about the movie?

i like the way he acts And Dakota Goyo plays Max Kenton and Evangeline Lilly plays Bailey Tallet is it  an action base film ? Hugh is a great actor It is a sports science film kind of weird sounding lol where can i watch this film ? Its probably on dvd, amazon, or even Netflix the movie is pretty old 2011 In 2020, human boxers are replaced by robots well 7 years is not that old so the movie is like an AI drama Charlie Kenton played by Hugh Jackman is a former boxer and owns "Ambush" and loses in  a fight against bull belonging to promoter Ricky You think Its kind of AI Ricky rigged the fight to mess with Charlie well i ment it because of the robots Yes, it certainly is an artificial intelligence film sounds like a fun movie It does Charlie now has a debt to Ricky are they doing a second movie ? Probably not since the movie didn't get a very good ratings is it a disney movie ? Lots of cliched moments according to reviews, however, there were some good reviews calling it great family entertainment It is a Dreamworks movie i like Dreamworks movies

Nice! haha Basically a war flick. Gotta love a good Amazon princess movie. Have you heard anything about when its available on iTunes? More about her internal battles than the WWI battles. very engaging mm hmm I've seen the action scene only in batman vs superman She relies on love to stop war. is it as good as that scene? have you seen batman vs superman? Can't hold a good warrior woman down! They tried to forbid her from training but as it turns out, they needed her. Not sure why it got poor reviews. neat element of mystery too. She was raised on a hidden island for Amazon warrior women. I haven't seen that movie. sorry I can't compare sorry, I don't know when it's available on iTunes and missed that question earlier. Do you watch many movies that way? I prefer the theaters, but I have a new born so I can't really go to the theaters for a few months! lol Itunes are okay, but I'd rather watch things on netflix or amazon prime. Or even better, if direcTV plays them for free, I'll totally watch it I understand that. I really like the scene in the movie where she receives a photographic plate of herself and some gues from WWI which makes her recall her past. Adds some mystery. How old is wonderwomen anyways lol Has she been around for awhile? Would you say there was a lot of story ? or was it mostly action scenes? I have no idea how old she is!?! It was a great balance of action and storyline. haha hope I can watch it soon! is there a part 2 to the movie?
i just like reading it . not as much as chinese history though well i could share but my poetry is very personal so i get shy
do you have any other favorite things to do ? playing bingo and binge watching netflix .
The fact that Kiera Knightley was one of the main characters really blew my mind. It's beautifully written. But I can see why you don't like it She and Benedict Cumberbatch are always pretty good, but Hollywood changes too many things to make them more fake and overdramatic and I don't like that. I think I'm actually just really into historical drama. That's true actually. It isn't as original as how I would've expected it to be. I think the story could have been much better if there hadn't been so much artistic license. I guess it doesn't help that I'm not into historical dramas. Totally get your point. I just like I think the attractiveness combined with charisma of the starts in the movie
yeah its some great running music i will dig into it . you ever excercise
have you always wanted to teach ? yes for as long as i can remember hat is great to have lifetime plans on what you want to be
Yes, it would be fun to see him interact with the toys and hide it from his parents. It's funny when the army men spy on the party . they are awesome characters It's also funny when Buzz shows up and impresses everyone - except I wanted Woody to punch him at first. Then he grew on me. wow punch him? those are some intense feelings No, it's just a figure of speech. I really meant outdo him. Get the best of him, so to speak. Ive never heard anyone use that term as a figure of speech punching someone is not a figure of speech Okay, sorry. Let's get back to the movie. okay, I love my potato head mr Sid's dog, Scud is funny. Yes, Don Rickles was perfect for Mr. Potato Head. hahahahaha my dog looks just like him Really, that's hilarious! And cute, too! yeah, I get really sad watching the movie disney movies always hit home Sad? Yes, I know what you mean.

i have no idea what that is digital currency do you travel any ?
y particular artists you like ? oh , i enjoy them all . how about you ?
The director is David Fincher Ok. Did you enjoy his work and the movie is about Mark Zuckerberg, and how this 19 year old student at the time started his journey to create Facebook Yeah, I did enjoy his work, I thought the movie was really interesting and it has great movie ratings That sound enterpraising that tells you a lot about the movie It is right up my alley. it has a Rotten Tomatoes score of 9/10 and a Metacritic score of 95/100 both pretty good I love what I am hearing. The actors are also pretty good I liked how they acted in the movie Thank you for the info It is really useful. Im glad im being able to help! so would you like to know who the actors are? I think you should be an advocate in your circle, when it comes down to movies. Yes, sure, please. Yeah I agree. and the main actors are Jesse Eisenberg as Mark Zuckerberg and Andrew Garfield as Eduardo Saverin Ok. I am fallowing you. I hope you watch it! you wont regret it
hat is not the best trait to have .
It was a good idea. People really get patriotic about a black and white good vs evil when it comes to the World Wars I was expecting it to get more Oscar nominations.. you know, more than zero Ya especially for Gal Gadot She was a shoo-in, I would have thought. Or Patty Jenkins I thought going with the angle of her being 100% innocent was a little over the top though, but I chalk that up to more writing/directing then acting. How did you feel about the twist of the villain? I mean, I think the whole idea was that she's been overly sheltered in a utopia her whole life It was good! I can honestly say I didn't see it coming. How about you?
i love country . especially tyler farr . swoon .
i love the names . it sounds like you have a house full . hobbies ? crafts , sewing , playing with grand babies . you ? painting , writing , hiking , and helping out with rescue animals . i had 3 other dogs . feebles , minion barbie . minion got killed . others died .
thats true, if they can keep the cast and crew together I think the chances of it being a hit increase. I believe thats more then 3 exchanges we've had about the movie now
sheesh , i can barely get 8 hours of sleep . i like to swim while i drive swimming is fun . do you go to the beach as well ?
you are very helpful friend . nice . what do you thin about acting , i hate acting . i do not act but i use to years ago . why do you not like it ?
yea this movie is really good its one of those movies that you just want to keep watching if part two on the making definitely i will be going to watching it that's so true yes with all the new super heroes it would be interesting have u seen black panther?.... i heard it really good what do you think of when furry used the death to encourage the avengers it was sick, was on point...... yea that sure got them motivated yeah yea the hulk catching iron man was great the hulk kicks butt that part was sick i laugh so hard hw old r u if . u don't mind me asking? I'm 24 you? 25 do you watch a lot of movies? sometimes wen i have the time are u a woman r man? yea i hear ya man you? woman cool nice talking to about the movies talking bye do like horror movies? bye
yes , but there are many more years to go ! are you married ?
That's awesome! She plays a starring role in this film and received pretty high accolades for the film. Does a movie about a football player interest you? Depending on what else the movie is about . I am not huge into sports but very open minded when it comes to movies. Well, this is a biographical drama film about Michael Oher who went on to play for the Baltimore Ravens in the NFL. To that end, it explores issues related to his humble upbringings. The film also scored an A+ from CinemaScore and some decent ratings from Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic as well. Sounds like a very inspirational movie, I would be interested in watching , would you give it a good ratings based off what you know. I've seen the movie before, and personally, I believe it to be a really inspirational film. However, according to the information I have assuming I hadn't seen it, I would absolutely be interested in exploring it. It takes place not too far away from the area in which I grew up, and from the information here, there are some really interesting actors in addition to Sandra Bullock such as Tim McGraw. Some really strong source material also helps to support the quality of the film.
Do you have a loaded document? Yes, I do. I'm not seeing anything but the chat box? I know. What is the movie discussion about? What movie? Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice 2016 I've never seen it have you? It's ok, but way too long. Cast: Ben Afleck as Bruce Wayne/Batman Henry Cavil as Clark Kent/Superman Great actors don't you agree? What is the movie about? You know, the regular superhero film Eighteen months after the battle between Superman and General Zod in Metropolis,Superman has become a controversial figure. Billionaire Bruce Wayne, who has operated inGotham City as the vigilante Batman for two decades, sees Superman as an existentialthreat to humanity. After learning of Batman's form of justice, Clark Kent seeks to exposehim via Daily Planet articles. Wayne learns that Russian weapon trafficker Anatoli Knyazevhas been contacting LexCorp mogul Lex Luthor. Meanwhile, Luthor unsuccessfully tries topersuade Senator June Finch to allow him to import kryptonite retrieved from the IndianOcean following Zod's terraforming attempt, claiming he wants to maintain it as a"deterrent" against future Kryptonian threats. He instead makes alternative plans withFinch's subordinate and gains access to Zod's body and the Kryptonian Do you normally watch movies of that type?

They are in an infinite subconscious world That sounds kind of confusing. Anything more? Or any other key scenes from the movie? The main characters are only asleep for a few hours, however, it was really 50 years in a dream That is crazy, what is the name of the movie? The name of the movie is The Inception Do you know when it came out? The movie came out in 2009 What else can you tell me about the scenes?# There was a planted idea that the main character saw his own father in the dream state Do you think teh movie is good?

I do like some war movies. It all depends. I'll have to look into it. dunkirk starts off with chaos and horror from the onset, really making you feel a part of it with great images do you usually watch war movies with high ratings? The thing about war movies and some other ones is that you really get into some characters and then they die. in the movie they do have some people die but they have some great saves by air boat and land

It had a good message about how differences should not dictate what one can and cannot do in life. Don't you agree? Yep, I also though it was incredible that the film received a 98% on rotten tomatoes. I agree. It had a good rating because it was a good movie with a positive message portrayed through its rabbit and fox characters. I think my favorite character was Judy Hopps. Such a cute little rabbit.

I'm not sure if I've seen any of his other movies. Gatsby was visually appealing but I would argue it's lacking in substance. Perhaps that's a characteristc of Lurhmann i think he is quite the visionary, and the production standard is always high. I enjoyed first season of the 'get down'.. do you think the use of 3D in the movie was warranted? oops, there is no mention of 3D...
Did you like it? I personally, LOVE the movie. It does. RDJ, Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo Chris Hemsworth, ScarJo and Renner all do a great job in the movie? Yes, I really liked the movie as well. I'm a big Joss Whedon fan so I figured this movie was BOUND to be good. :) Yes, I didn't realize though who Loki was until I read this document, lol Like I said, the movie was great but I didn't like the way they used Loki.

hi Hello! How are you? Any movie recommendations? actually i did not get any documents they directed me to the chat directly Ok! Well have you seen the recent Oscar winning movie Shape of Water do you have any movie recommendations? nope but i heard about that movie Cool! What info have you heard about the film so far i heard that the movie was good and nice story did u watch the movie? That’s fine cause here my chance to sell you on how great the film is! what is ur opinion about the movie? I love the film. It takes all the tropes old school horrors and turns it into a romance okies what was the story about? Now the question for me is if you are interested in that sort of genre. It’s about a mute lady that works as a janitor in a science facility who has an affinity for water and eventually falls in love with the creature from the black lagoon ohh the story sounds good Perfect the film takes place in the 50s during a time of racial and gender tension so the romance parallels those tribulations some people are saying when they watch this film it resembles the Beauty and the Beast  movie is  that true? Definitely! Except the only thing is that he stays in his monster form ohh okies how would to u rate the movie out of 10? Are you willing to give it a shot? Id give it 9 out of the 10. The villain was sort of typical okies Any other questions about the film?

How cool that they added Mr Potato Head lol Buzz becomes one of Andy's favorite toys and Woody begins to feel left out, so Woody decides to trap him, that doesn't work and they both end up at a pizza place for a family outing. This sounds like an interesting adventure! I need to see this movie! At the pizza place Buzz still thinks that he is a space ranger, despite woody trying to convince him otherwise, and they end up stuck inside a crane game, where Andy's toy-killing neighbor Sid ends up winning them in the crane game. A toy-killing neighbor? That sounds scary for the toys! Sid takes the two toys home and they end up meeting a bunch of other toys that sid had torn apart, and they become really scared, but they end up escaping.

Then I saw it on tv I believe and it just fascinated me! For some reason I did not get to finish it again I only watched half of it ok So back to the task, I suppose..the main actor is Leonardo DiCaprio..he's a well known actor, another reason to watch this movie yes i know (i'm just following instructions to convince you) yes In the movie, a dying dreamer goes into Limbo..and a dreamer might forget they are in a dream Dom Cobb (Leonardio DiCaprio) reactivates a totem, which is an object that dreamers use to distinguish dreams from reality, to remind the dreamer that it's not real dreamer might forget they are in a dream It's funny because the dreamer Cobb was trying to wake up committed suicide and framed him for a murder charge He had to leave his children behind as he had to flee the US that seems very tough! ok I guess Cobb did kind of feel guilty about Mal's death He struggled to make peace with it which is an object that dreamers use to distinguish dreams from reality, to remind the dreamer that it's not real Yeah, and that object, the totem, looked like a spinning top that would keep spinning spinning top would keep At the end it seems Cobb did tests to prove he was in the real world But even though he knew the correct results he ignored them

Yes, this was one of his best roles. What do you think about the rating of the movie What did you think of Margot Robbie? was it fair I thought the rating was a bit on the low side. I'd have given it at least an 8. What did you think of the rating? I did as well i thought it should have been much higher It was a great action packed movie that kept me on the edge of my seat Yea especially the cinema score of  C. that was strange I completely agree. Yea the drama was intense. I always wanted to know what was going to happen next Could you ever deal with a job like that? no, i think the drugs and prostitutes and fast life would be a bit much for me. I However did love the part when Jordan train the are of the "Hard sell" it is so clever to get what he wants

I'm not entirely sure okay well i think i know enough about the movie now Yeah, there isn't much more to be said without spoiling the whole thing i will probably see it anyways, have to see all the comic movies these days! There are some cool scenes when superman fights with batman, but the dialogue is pretty lame when the fight concludes still, it's worth seeing if you're a fan of comic book movies yeah i don't love affleck as batman, but i've heard he did okay i'm gonna see justice league later today so maybe that will put me in the mood

that is really cool. it definitely has a good message for kids Judy herself learns not to stereotype, and publicaly admits to her mistakes. she learns to get to know individual's stories and learn some of the reasons that they act the way they do. so yeah, it has a great message and it's funny and cute and the animation is really well done, so I definitely recommend it.

i enjoy eating like spi y food
And I enjoyed that it was based on a true story that was a good part of the movie: a true story of a rising sports star yes she usually isn't in anything serious so this was a good change for her and it was emotional too, in a way that she gave this orphaned boy a chance to do soemthing great in life! I didn't really like the actor that played Big Mike though which actor was that? yeah I enjoyed that she really cared for this boy to have a better life I don't think he's anyone too famous. I just remember the actor not being very good for this role Oh, I see, Quinton Aaron yes, I don't recall him too well Tim McGraw was pretty good though he is not really an actor but did well I liked how Sandr Bullock's character didn't care what other people thought of her taking in this troubled kid in order to help him Oh yeah I forgot he was in this movie too I think he was the husband yes, she typically plays light-headed fools, but in this one she was very strong-willed and determined! yes, he was its sad that Big Mike didn't think Leigh Anne had good intentions for taking him in. He probably never experienced true care before since his mother was addicted to drugs He was emotionally damaged and never got that motherly love to understand and before of her, he got into college which definitely changed his life for the better
really love music , listen to at certain time and feel the music
re you a good skateboarder ? yeah i am pretty good i think but compared to other people not really

I still think it's a great movie to watch today, even though it was released in 2010, about 8 years ago. I thought Vector's character was perfect too; he embodied the "dorky" evil genius kind of kid. I agree. My kids watch it practically every day! It's hard to believe it came out 8 years ago! I thought it was really funny how Vector had the pyramid of Giza in his yard painted like the sky. No one will ever know!

Hi! Hello We get to talk about The Notebook.  Have you seen it? I haven't seen it. Tell me about it. It sounds really interesting! It's striking in its rich, saturated effects and the actors are blessed by good material It has a rotten tomatoes score of 52% It stars Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams That's an okay score for rotten tomatoes. I usually don't base my movie choices off of their scoring system. Ryan Gosling is a great actor! I love everything he plays in. What's the plot? Love story? Me too!  This movie was out in 2004 so I'm surprised you didn't see it It's a romantic drama Written by Nicholas Sparks I know right? It sounds like something I would definite be interested in. I was a senior in school in 2004, and a movie hopper. I'm surprised I haven't seen it either. Is it a movie you would watch repeatedly? If you crave big, gooey over the top romance, it's a must see movie Will it have me on the edge of my seat?

It currently stands an 8 out of 10 and 92% on Rotten Tomatoes Wow, that’s great! Pretty good. Would you deem it as a classic? Do you think it’s rating should be better? An MCU classic at least, but not a philmography classic. I agree! I don't want to be that person but I am still waiting on a Super Hero film to be as good as the Dark Knight, than again I am sort of biased Biased? Why? I am a mega Batman fan! I can't help it! Same here But I still like Marvel better though. They are definitely doing a better job overall Hopefully So, do you know any interesting trivia about the Avengers or something? It is the fourth highest grossing film of all time. Under Avatar, Star Wars, and Jurassic World Wait, really? That’s absoultely great It was a great movie and I’m glad people are showing it. Yes! Are you looking forward to Black Panther and the Infinity War For sure, I’m more expectant of Infinity war tho. You?
i am doing alright on this rany night do you listen to music ? yes i do my favorite is country do you know how to play guitar o i do not and i do not know how to play musica
only downside is the temptation to speed . already got a few tickets .

i usually cook seafood and also rice , it is my favorite . sounds good do you like music ? i like alternative
I agree. Too much blood. I would definitely not let my child watch it until he is old enough I wonder how old would be old enough. Maybe it depends on the child. I don't remember what rating Jaws had -- or did they even have ratings in 1975? Hi, are you still there?
hat is a great profession , i prefer to work with animals . cool . i like animals but cannot have any , allergies . do you currently work as a medical professional while attending school ? ope i am just a student , how about you ? i am done with school and work with animals now with peta .
I like WWII movies. Don't we all? I know I do as well. The only part of the movie I did not enjoy was the depth they went into to show his personal life. I thought it took away from the intellectual focus of the movie to decode the German ENIGMA machine. I watched a WWII movie in the past - it was non fiction.  It was interesting.  The title had the word "needle".  Do you know the full title? It was about a German spy who killed people using a needle. Is it called Eye of the Needle, maybe? Yes.  I also red the novel. I have never seen it, but it sounds like the movie you are describing. I meant "read" I am not a good typist. Oh, I did not know it was based on a novel. There is never a guarantee those movies will turn out well. Sadly some Steven King and other novelist movies have really good books that turn into poor movies. There was one with Johnny Depp that was based on a Steven King movie that I did not like at all. Do you know the one I'm talking about?
I think the Blind Side would be a good one What's it about? it will take your mind of of things, as well as but faith back in people That sounds like something I need after the week I have had. Will it make me cry? its a true story about a women who basically takes in a kid from the inner city he plays football and thigns good very good for him, but of couse there are time s when you eill cry Oooh! I love football movies.  And a true story? How many kids does she take in? she has two kids, one in hig school  then one younger then the black kid she takes in becomes apart of this family Oh wow.  Do the kids get along? We did foster care and it was a nightmare with a 2 year old and 14 year old and its a total white southern family the kids love him its all about love its more about him trying to be better in school

Scarlett Johansson i'm in. lol. Shes awesome in this movie who would you say played the best part?

I agree 100% The new information about key scene number 2 sounds kind of interesting. It says that the supervillain adopts three girls. That could be super funny or just a cinematic disaster
Do you speak Spanish or English Do you speak Spanish or English what did you think about the batman movie what did you think about the batman movie
i live with my mom and dad and they watch them all the time .
Love classic Disney for sure.  disney is not my main interest but love Marvel and their movies, especially the Avengers series. Scarlett Johansson was really great as Natasha. I've always really liked Scarlett Johansson and the Natasha character. my fave is clark gregg Yes. Samuel L. Jackson was a nice surprise as well.
That was news to me too! Who was your favorite character? Lindsay Lohan and Rachael McAdams did a great job with their characters How about you? Who did you like? I agree! I thought it deserved higher than 84% on Rotten Tomatoes Yes, the A- score seems more fair! I loved Amanda Seyfried's character! I don't really follow directors much, are you familiar with Mark Waters? She was hilarious!! I am not familiar with him. I never quite grasped why Cady's parents didn't just continue to homeschool her after twelve years! That is a good question, maybe they wanted her to have a more "normal" school experience? That would be a giant culture shock going from the plains of Africa to a city in the US. That was my first thought! I loved the characters Janice and Damian. They made the whole movie in my opinion! Yes, it was definitely the mean girls who made it! Haha! Maybe that's why it's called that! Haha probably! The story line of Janice using Cady to get back at Regina for revenge from something done to her in the past was interesting. Cady is obviously a vulnerable subject to get used in that way having been sheltered from "normal" school life for so long My jaw dropped when Regina was hit by the school bus! That was definitely a surprise! And yet really funny! Hilarious! It made me sad when they called Ms. Norbury a drug dealer! She seemed so cool. That whole book was so mean I'm glad they finally realized how horrible they were being I know! I thought it was weird how the book only contained stuff about the girls and a few teachers. No boys. Boy students however I thought it was sweet when she gave pieces of her tiara away Yes, and that she was able to become who she really was, or go back to who she really was...

I really like the movie and how it covers the view from a villain's perspective. I agree. I also liked the movie and really enjoyed that it was a family film. The Minions provide an extra dose of humor too Yes, they are a favorite among many people. Do you like animated films? Yes I do, especially since I have kids Do you have kids? I do, I did not realize that this was a debut film.  I assumed it was one of the more familiar animation company films. Yes, it was the first film in the franchise from a few years ago Is there going to be a new paragraph showing up? Nevermind, there it is It's funny to see a movie where two villians are against each other rather than a hero and a villian I agree It makes it almost more enjoyable since it is a new spin It got pretty good reviews too Exactly. The actor's performances and the minions contributed to the reviews greatly. A cast that everyone grew to love. Yes, I didn't realize Russell Brand was in it And I am not sure these directors have done anything else noteworthy? Other than this movie series, I do not believe so. Well I always have loved Steve Carell yes, he is a funny actor
I haven't heard of Peter Benchley...has he written many books? Do you know how long the running time is on the movie? Who is Michael? I don't know how long it is.  Michael is a character - the son of the police chief. Have you seen this movie yourself? In another scene a character goes down in a shark-proof cage, but the shark demolishes it.  Luckily the character escapes. I have seen it. How do they escape?  What else can you tell me?
It came out in 2009. Wow, time flies! Who played Michael Oher? A fine actor by the name of Quinton Aaron What was Sandra Bullock's character's name? Bullock took on the role of Leigh Anne Tuohy. Did the movie win any Oscars? Unfortunately not, there must've been some strong contenders that year. Do you know how long the movie is? Nope, it probably had a decent length.
y wife asked me for a divorce today . oddly , that does not bother me too much . sorry to hear that ! did you see it coming ? o , i should have though . i was in mexico four times for business this year . hopefully , everything will be civil and you both will be happier after . . .

Keanu Reeves did a really great job in the movie John Wick, don't you think so? I do think so.  I think this was the perfect role for him. I believe this was the first installment for the movie series. Yes and it had very good reviews which is probably why they made another. I think it is an interesting story line having John Wick be a retired hitman Yes a Rotten Tomatoes score of 86% is really good! Do you remember who played the head of the Tarasov family?
well that is not true , people in the artic probably do not i think they would if it was not so cold what do you do to relax ? i really am into history i read constantly about historical figures it never really gets cold here in florida
I just watched it and its soooo good Critics seem to really like it too. I guess I need to watch it! you've got to really like historical stuff though do you like war movies? if you do you'd like it i think Ugh no I don't but it says it's about a cryptanalyst that decrypted intelligence codes and that sounds awesome to me I just don't like combat movies but spy movies are cool haha well the cast is good enough and its not too heavy on the whole war stuff. but it's good to go into the movie with a background or the audience would be pretty confused in this movie Looks like its also a love story. Of course. Typical movie formula 91% on rotten tomatoes is a pretty fantastic score i guess thats how they got such high ratings. they had to cater to everyone but what else can you expect when they hired benedict cumberbatch as the lead role catering to all his fans probably hahaha Haha I like him! Yeah you're right Oh I just caught that it starts in 1951 and is told as flash-backs to the war yeah, its kind of a new take on the typical world war 2 movie Cool I think I may give this movie a shot! i really think you'll like it! It may not seem like your type of movie but the reviews dont lie! I like Keira Knightley alright too in some stuff yeah keira is pretty versatile and it shows in this movie There is one critic second to last who really seemed to hate the movie haha and the last guy from Science News was "disappointed" but clearly majority of critics had good things to say yeah, but i feel like those people were expecting too much. I think the Empire took it for what it was. just a form of entertainment Yeah it seems to be based on true events? If I am interpreting this correctly so whenever something really happened there will be criticisms like that. The real life purists that don't enjoy a creative spin yeah judging by the synopsis, this story actually did happen
i just came home from a school dance , i was ariel . do you dance ? i do not dance . i am very bad at it . i have been taking lessons since i was three , now i do competitions . wow that is very cool ! do you like cats ? i do , although we have several dogs now . i love dogs . do you ? i do , especially huskies and springer spaniels . what is your favorite type of dog breed ? do you have memory or concentration problems ?

yeah, its a movie based in the future. Human fighters no longer fight so they use robots to fight. What are they fighting for? It does have some similar aspects of Irobot but this it isnt trying to show that robots are taking over.
started out impersonating paul mccartney and ended up owning several casinos re you an indian by chance ?
i go to festivals with my friends
Hi hi Let's talk monsters university Ok! Monsters University​ is a 2013 American 3D computer-animated comedy film produced by PixarAnimation Studios for Walt Disney Pictures.[6] Wow, I love Disney movies tell me more It was directed by Dan Scanlon and produced byKori Rae, with John Lasseter, Pete Docter, Andrew Stanton and Lee Unkrich as executiveproducers. What is it about? Monsters Universitytells the story of two monsters, Mike and Sulley, and their time studying at college, where theystart off as rivals, but slowly become best friends. John Goodman, Billy Crystal, Steve Buscemi, Bob Peterson, and John Ratzenberger reprise their roles as James P. Sullivan, Mike Wazowski It seems like a wholesome movie, I would love to see it Here's the beginning scene Michael "Mike" Wazowski, a 7-year-old monster, aspires to become a scarer – a monsterwho enters the human world at night to scare children and harvest their screams for energy– when he grows up after visiting Monsters Inc., Monstropolis' most profitable scaringcompany, on a school field trip. What happens to make him want to go? Did someone inspire him? Not sure Eleven years later, Mike is a first-year scare major atMonsters University, where he meets fellow monster, James P. "Sulley" Sullivan. Mikestudies hard, while the privileged Sulley, coming from a family of talented scarers, reliesonly on his natural ability and begins to falter. He sounds stuck up ha yeah As the semester progresses, Mike and Sulleyattempt to join a fraternity, but only Sulley is accepted into Roar Omega Roar, the strongestfraternity on campus. At the semester's final exam, a fight between the two causes them toaccidentally break Dean Abigail Hardscrabble's cherished Scream Can. Hardscrabble failsboth of them immediately, stating that Sulley does not study enough, and Mike is not scaryenough. Do they manage to get back into the university? yeah Wanting to prove himself, Mike enters the university's "Scare Games", and makes a wagerwith Hardscrabble to reinstate him and his team to the scare program if they win, but Mikemust leave the university if they lose. He joins a group of misfits named Oozma Kappa, theweakest fraternity on campus, but they are denied entry to the Games for being one teammember short. Sulley subsequently joins them, seeing the competition as his ticket backinto the scare program. Oh so that's how they get back in, they must've won! What challenges did they have to do?

I would think so. People want to laugh at some point especially when things get to serious I agree. If the trailer looks good, I might see it, otherwise, nope. Keanu has been so serious lately hasn't  he? yeah. probably trying to shake off The Matrix stereotype or whatever it's called. LOL, thats true But I know in real life he's a decent guy. Would love to see him back with Sandra Bullock in another movie ''Semi deliberate zonked deadpan style''. That has to include a leather jacket I KNOW! how great were they together Hahahah for real! I don't know much about him really, except that he likes to take the subway

Greetings! So, what's this movie all about? Im not 100% because I have never seen it. But from the document I see on the left it looks like its about a super woman her name is wonder woman Ah, who stars in that again? I forget her name. Gal Gadot is the star of the movie and she plays Diana Prince also known as wonder woman in the movie Ah, she is absolutely stunning. A wonderful actress. And then there's that guy from Star Trek in it, right? not that I believe have you ever seen the movie? I've wanted to see it. Who is it directed by?

What is John Legend's role? He plays Sebastian's old friend Keith. He is in a successful band and he asks Sebastian to join in. Oh okay. Are there dance numbers involved? Yes, there is dancing, but some have said the dancing is not "exceptional" Is it available on DVD now? I am unable to determine if it is out on DVD at the moment. How much did it cost to make the movie? I'm not sure about that but something interesting about it is that after Mia and Sebastian fall in love, they get in a huge fight, and Mia moves back home to Boulder City from Los Angeles. Thus, ending their relationship. Well that sounds like a great spoiler ;) Are they both successful in their chosen field at the end?

When you see the movie, would you review it for a website? Yes That's great.  When you see it, please consider doing that so others can see what you thought. Yes Are you comitted to seeing the movie because of something new you learned in this conversation?
I love the quote "a work of genius".  Too bad there is nothing to say who these supposed critics are. I'm not saying it wasn't a work of genius, just that quotes taken out of context could have been taken from the director's family! They are also claiming it was often more interesting to adults than kids.  Do you think that was the case?  I am not sure that is necessarily a compliment
hi , i am doing very well ! you ?
While director Morten Tyldum did take some liberties in the source material, he brings together an all star cast and compelling drama to weave a thrilling tale. Indeed, it is dangerous to attempt to bring a biopic into the limelight and general box office; but this film performed well, and Tyldum's gamble paid off for him handsomely.
Hey hi did you like the movie? I haven't seen it but I like Keira Knightley and a lot of my friends are fans of Benedict CUmberbatch (although I've never seen his stuff before), so I'm assuming it's a decent movie. Have you seen this movie? Most of the reviews look good, except for the last two. I've heard of it but have never seen it. I happen to like Keira knightly too. Her and Matthew Goode are the only familiar ones to me. Nice, what else is Mathew Goode in? No clue off top lol. The name is just familiar lmao. Did you see the movie that its based on? No I have not. I did not realize it was based on another movie. apparently its based on another one. Wait do you have another document yet? or is it still just the one? Yeah I just saw the new document Wow this is deep and sad That's a pretty intense way to start the movie, I'm hooked. these don't show much information about the film. I'm honestly still confused on what the movie is even about you must have better documents than me lol I'm looking at Key Scene 1 I'm referring to Turing's feelings for Morcom I don't have that one yet it's on the top of the document :) ohh okay I see. I think it's because of the 3 response thing lol wow that is really sad poor turing

the critics seem to love david fincher the director and praise how he takes the story to another level A good director can make a lot of difference in the quality of a film. Aaron Sorkin is an excellent script writer so I'm sure a good script helped, too. It may be a bit difficult to talk at length about five lines of text, most of which is quotes from critics. LOL. its interesting how this all started because mark was dumped by his firlfriend girlfriend

The shark is opposed mostly by the local police chief, a shark hunter, and an oceanographer. Do you think it is a good movie for children? I saw it at a young age and it didn't do me any harm. Some critics clearly disagree, though. yes I also thoroughly enjoyed it even back then. A memorable scene is when a woman goes skinny dipping and is pulled under the water Yes, that's the opener, if I'm not mistaken. It's based on a novel that only came out shortly before the film. OK Some thought it was a boating accident it is a great example of speilbergs ability It is, and also was early in his career. Maybe his 3rd film in fact which for him is super early. yes i think it is from 1975 It is. Based on Peter Benchley's novel. Murray Hamilton is the mayor. A significant role, though not as big as Scheider/Dreyfuss/Shaw's parts. Amity island is the name of the fictonal town At one point, a tiger shark that's caught is mistakenly thought to be the culprit. roy shnider plays brody the poilice chief Richard Dreyfuss is Mat Hooper, the oceanographer that accompanies him. the mayor doesnt want to close the beaches initially He's concerned that closing them would result in less tourism, which isn't good for revenue in his eyes.

I agree. If I was Sebastian, I would have looked for a better opportunity. *wanted
Yes! I watched it several times. There are so many details i didn't notice at first Was there a big plot twist at the end that explained previous parts? Yes! Don't want to spoil but there was a twist and I was even googling what could the ending mean Is there a possibility of a sequel?  Or did it end definitively with no chance for another one? Do you like the idea of the movie? (that people can go into other people's dreams to get the information they need) I don't think there will be a sequel I do.  Sci-fi type movies are usually pretty fun, unless they're based on books for teens (like Twilight or Maze Runner) I agree, I love Sci-Fi movies Can't believe this movie came out 9 years ago Wow, that long ago? yes, it says it came out in 2009 I need to watch it again. it was good I may have to find it then to see for myself.  Since it's so old, I can probably find it for $5 or so on Amazon Or maybe even for free on demand

Baba Yaga is such a weird nickname for Wick. Do you know what it means? no. i didn't even realize that was a nick name for wick... Does it kind of remind you of those old school B-movies? the first one, not so much. but the action scenes are kinda over the top but that was the point i think The scene when he goes on a killing spree at the Red Circle nightclub is a prime example of over the top i don't remember that scene... do you remember the scene when he destroys Viggos money? oh. right. I would have took the money and bought a new dog instead of destroying it it's a poetic justice. you killed what means a lot to me i'm goign to destroy what means a lot to you type of thing The fight scene on the dock was crazy when Wick got stabbed, like he allowed it to happen. don't remember much about the individual scenes.. he gets stabbed ?

Huh, I didn't know that Turning had a thing for Christopher. Now that is way before their time period! He got interested in cryptography through a friendship and a begins to have feelings for his friend but he dies before those feelings can be expressed. Maybe, maybe not, more like it existed throughout all of time but just wasn't socially accepted at the time. Too bad! That could have made for an interesting plot twist. Which I gather would have disqualified him for the military position Oh, very true! I didn't think about that! Ha!  He names the machine after him. I just read that! lol Too funny Wow, so he does tell someone he is homosexual.
i guess it will come down to if he dies, or someone takes his spot

Is it action, drama, love? What genre? It's an SuperHero movie. It was the first time ever to feature Batman and Superman live together. Really? That's interesting because I've seen Superman and Batman as independent movies, but not with the superheroes together Does it have a good rating? On rotton tomatoe? It has an average of 4.9/10 on rotten tomatoe It's basically where Batman sees Superman as a threat to humanity, so the two go head-to-head That's really cool! Who is the main actor? There is Ben Affleck as Bruce Wayne and Henry Cavill as Clark Kent I love Ben Affleck!! Can I rent the movie at the library? Or on netflix? Is it accessible? There is no information available to me regarding where it is available. Okay, well as long as it's easy to find, I'm interested to watch it But the plot is interesting enough for you to search it out! There's kidnapping, villains, love and drama! oooh! It's at my town library! I can go and rent it there easily or I can rent or buy it on itunes Sounds like a fun plot to watch! that's great! those are great places to get new movies to watch Ever heard of director Zack Snyder?

Man I've got to see this I think that it would definitely hold a viewers attention for the full movie. I'd like to see it as well! Loki He's the Norse god of mischief I think Yes!  I believe so.  Is he in this though?  I don't see his name listed! I've heard of a Tesseract beofre Its up in the Key Scene Oh!  I see now. So Loki got to earth through a wormhole the Tesseract opened and he's going to try to take over the world I think It received great ratings!  I always look for that before I watch a movie. OMG it has the Hulk in it too! He's bad news, that's for sure! Yeah it says he and Thor fight it out It has a lot of those heros in it! And now they're trying to defend NYC! Is it still in the theaters?  I don't think that it is. No, but I bet it has a sequel, he review said it was a 7 part series I think. Okay, so I would probably need to watch the other movies first.

yeah, not interested. What genre do you like? I particularly enjoy these types of movies mostly because I am absolutely fascinated with 3D animation and the attention to detail given. Okay, AI robot dude. I prefer comedy Definitely not an AI. I have a bachelors in 3d animation and love these movies. I'm suspicious Cool. I'm just going to continue with trying to convince you to watch this movie because that's what I'm being paid to do. Okay, fine. Why should I watch it? There are lots of comedic moments especially since the main character is voiced by Jay Baruchel. I can't give any information outside of what is given, but look him up. What country is the movie made in? Is it a foreign film? America, it's American I've never heard of Jay Baruchel I also don't particularly enjoy watching movies. This is certainly the wrong HIT for you then. But if I had to choose, I prefer comedy. I would rather watch a TV show. I would argue that television shows are just drawn out movies. Yeah. I didn't know what to expect. Anyway, what's the name of the movie? How to Train Your Dragon Oh. I've heard of that. Have you seen it? I have and thoroughly enjoyed it. Okay, it's letting me finish the conversation now so I'm going to do that. I have to run to a meeting soon (I'm in grad school). Bye!

Evanston IL .....aren't you supposed to be inquiring about the film vs. me questioning your knowledge? I wasn’t aware this was based off of a novel Yes by Rosalind Wiseman It’s one of the top 50 greatest teen comedies as well But it was partially based off of it as that book is non-fiction I would agree According to Rotten Tomatoes especially they have a great audience there I agree it does highlight a bit of bullying amongst teen girls today Yes. Even though the epidemic of bullying crosses gender lines

i agree How is Hugh's acting ? I kinda like him ! in the beginning a former human boxer owns a robot boxer, and he lost a fight because it was rigged, and couldnt pay the debt his acting is pretty good nice. so what determines which robot is better?  just based on its engineering ? which ever one gets destroyed first i guess no I get that, but is that really a battle of scientists - who will build a better, faster, stronger machine ? yes thats how it is , also the human controls the robot as if h is fighting himself he * oh, so there is some human intervention. That seems a little bit more like a sport Did You like that movie ? How was the rating ? hugh jackman aka who has a son in the movie brings his robot for another match and wins, the champion robot is owned by the guy who charlie lost to last time tries to buy "atom" charlies robot but his son max refuses and challenegs "Zeus " the movie ws ok it was 5.9/10 uu...  not the highest rating. Are the CGIs at least decent ? yes it was decent

what did you think of the Wolf On Wall Street? I really liked it I’ve watched it a couple of times now and it still interests me Me as well. Leonardo was great. He produced it s well. I didn’t know he produced it I didn't before I went to see it either You saw it in the cinemas? Matthew McConaughey and Rob Reiner were excellent too I don’t know the names of the co actors But it seems like you have researched about it The document to your left supplies that information :) Ahh i was telling it out of memory Ah. Who was your favorite person in the movie? Leonardo dicaprio itself Yes. It was interesting when he made a small fortune at the boiler room brokerage firm. Yes The way he grew into a big time money businessman Critics thought it was epic in size, but narrow in scope... do you agree with that? Why or why not? I don’t really think it was narrow in scope I didn't either but I wanted to see how others opinions differed from critics. Do you think there will be a sequel? I don’t thinks so It was a real life based story I've never actually encountered a sequel for a real life story before Yes a memoir of Jordan Belfont, right? Yes exactly

That seems very interesting The movie definitely got me thinking about what my toys were up to when I wasn't home. This movie got a 100% on Rotten Tomatoes and an average of 9/10 for most other critic scores. Lol.  It would seem that you still have an active imagination With a score like that, everyone should go and see the movie! Yes, it would seem so Didn't Steve Jobs start Pixar? The movie came out in 1995 but it's presence is strongly felt to this day I am not sure about that but did you know that a six year old was the one who owned al of the toys? Wasn't there a sequel? Andy, the boy's, birthday party was moved up and there was a mess! The toys quickly came together to find out what andy got for his birthday. Then what happened after? They thought they wouldn't be replaced by another toy til Buzz Lightyear came out of the box. That is the astronaut? Yes! Ok.  They named him after an actual astronaut All the other toys are amazed at what Buzz does, including Andy, and Woody gets sad Out of jealousy, Woody tries to trap Buzz and hide him forever! Even toys get jealous.  Imagine that. Plans don't turn out the way they think though and suddenly they are captured by the evil next door neighbour Yes, the evil child is very important for moving along the story. Of course! They have to be captured THE DAY the family is moving! What happens next Then, they are in the evil kid's house and the dog finds the toys, Scud. Is that a potato? The toys quickly plot and escape Scud and the toys are somehow able to get Buzz's rocket working and they shoot off. Scud is the dog. The toys hope to get there in order to be safe with Andy Ok, I figure that out. How does the story continue?

there's a song written just for this movie by Pharell. It's not too much music, and it's probably too hard for kids to memorize & sing constantly, but there are characters called Minions that dance and act very silly oh ok. lol sounds like my kind of movie. I'm a big kid at heart is the movie pretty long or standard? me too, I really enjoyed it. It's a good mix of funny and feel-good, Gru eventually adopts three little girls who help him steal the moon. It is not too long, maybe 1.5 hours oh that is not bad at all. i think i will look forward to seeing this movie with my kids. should keep their attention for awhile. lol lol it definitely will! although they might just want to watch it over and over again

Especially when its a kids movie. You definitely want something that will teach the kids a life lesson. I've never heard of illumination Entertainment. If this was their debut film they should have put more effort into advertisement. I agree.  I find it humorous that film companies worry so much about ratings.  I have never worried about that.  If it looks good I watch it.

why are your clothes not great ?
About 17 and older 17 to which age 17-23 I mean Though anyone super interested in Facebook in general would be interested in the movie ok thanks.. so how accurate is the movie actually It's a biographical drama, so it's based on real life but not every specific detail is accurate It has the drama surrounding the Winklevoss twins And about him being at Harvard, that much is definitely true Hmm, I dont know much about facebook's history so I would have to google that. :) is the movie motivational or inspiring? I'm sure it is, it shows the successful birth of Facebook is it available on netflix? There's some turmoil during the movie though the social network gets created eventually It might be Seeing that it's 95/100 on metacritic I'm sure it's easily available somewhere perfect thanks Sure :) surprisingly I have genuinely never seen the film :) take care now Have a good day

Hi! Hello there! How are you today? I'm good thanks.  Do you ever watch good computer animated kids movies? I do, Pixar and DreamWorks movies are my favorite. How about you do you like animated movies? I like them quite a bit.  One of my favorite ones is Mosters University. It is a Pixar movie that came out in 2013. Monsters University is a good one! Is that the latest one you've seen? I hear it is a lot different than Monsters, what is it about? It's a prequel to 2001's Monsters, Inc. It's about how Sulley and Mike met each other in college while studying. Oh, awesome. I need to check that out. I really like both of those characters. Sulley is the blue one, right? Yes, Sulley comes from a pedigreed scarer background but is lazy at his studies. They try to join a fraternity, but only Sulley gets accepted. Well, Mike is a little awkward. with the one eye and all. Mike studied very hard.  He is the little one. Do you know if his parents have one eye as well? What does Mike do when he doesn't get into the frat? Mike joins a weaker fraternity, and Sulley joins them to help them try to win the Scare Games. Do the train for the games? Because Sulley was kicked out of the Scare Program for not studying enough. Oh no, he got kicked out?! I think they just use their knowledge and compete to win, and of course their ability.

yes I was very pleased with the fact that Gwenyth Paltrow had a strong femal character female yes that was good. It nice to have a strong female character. I love the scene where he flies in and attaches himself to the F-22. that was an amazing scene i think its funny how he names himself iron man Oh and when Pepper is in the building it gets so intense. usually superheroes get their names from citizens it does! the suspense was crazy LOL i know. He names himself. is he even made of iron? like how do we know?

I agree. Like one critic says that it's a movie that populated with human beings - I think we can all relate to that, hmm? It's true a critic responded saying the characters are props to deliver a story but just because it's meant to deliver a story, you should still feel sympathy. imagine this happened off screen That's exactly it - why watch a movie unless you can imagine it happening on some level? Like one critic says, it's too gruesome for children. Why? Because they can imagine it happening, obviously. And all of the major internet movie sites love it if you go by their rankings, even Rotten Tomatoes gives it a 9.2 I can't believe it got such a high rating Sure it's a thriller type movie to give the audience a scare but the feedback of the ratings are incredible. I would have thought a scaring film like this would get more negative feedback instead Me too. I also didn't know that it was originally a novel! The book came out in 1974 and by 1975 they already had the movie! then again, I guess the audience know what theyre going in for so it's enjoyable to them In a short amount of time, the book must have been quite popular

i am big into collecting , but cannot afford paintings , i get to see them though !
Yes, the differences between a simple man Nick Carraway,and the rich Gatsby was intriguing me through the whole movie They were neighboors but so different

i have never had sushi . it is delicious ! my all time favorite . what is yours ? i love eating shrimp . my favorite is shrimp alfredo or scampi .
Exactly, I've always known that you have to know how to accept comics in movies, but that lex crearaa doomsday does not seem right Yea I mean Doomsday has never been about backstory but of all things hes supposed to be alien. and the way in which superman has differences with batman is not the best explained, it's almost for no reason

Its funny because after seeing some of his other work its really hard to imagine him as a good villain I think both of them are generally over the top though
Did you enjoy this movie? I did.  There were moments where I found it pretty boring, but I think all in all it was pretty decent.  What about you? I may be biased because I really enjoy any type of war movies but I loved it! Would you say you agreed with the ratings given by various movie reviewing cites? I think so, yeah.  I couldn't find any glaring problems with it. Do you typically agree with movie ratings? I think it's 50/50, generally.  Sometimes they're spot on, sometimes they just seem completely wrong. Especially Rotten Tomatoes.  How do you feel about ratings? I agree, I try not to go use ratings as a deciding factor on whether or not I go see a movie. I feel like I would miss movies I would enjoy if I only used ratings to decide what to see. Sometimes I'll default to checking ratings if it's a movie I don't know much about.  If it gets really low (like 10% or less), I'll definitely skip it.  But there's been 3 or 4 that ended up actually being really good. What did you think of the authenticity of the film? It is tough for me to judge authenticity since I haven't actually experienced war, but it felt very real to me. I was surprised by Harry Styles' performance. Did you know he could act? Nope, I had absolutely no idea.  Honestly, I didn't even know who he was until I just researched him.  Considering the band he's from, I'm even more surprised. I agree. I would've thought he would've ruined the character, but he did a good job as Alex. How gripping of a character was George for you, and the whole blindness/death that happens? I liked George's character a lot and was disappointed when he died. I also thought it was smart that they did not tell the rescued officer that he died. What did you think of the moments when Gibson revealed his true identity?
ll mea joke funny person
i do not have siblings at all . just a degree in communication oh i wish that were me i am the youngest out of 8 ! lol . and neat . what kind of music do you like ? i am a hardcore metal head and you ?

y parents would love me to go to oxford . but i was to stay in the states . you are more familiar with things locally i assume . definitely . maybe new york university would be fun hat would give you a lot to do in the area . yup . it would be amazing .
A Walk to Remember was also made into a film! True Especially for being in 2004. I believe I have heard of the director, Nick Cassavetes, before. I would still think Ryan Gosling would bring a higher rating. Yes, he directed My Sisters Keeper. I would think so too! He was recently in the new BladeRunner Allison is an heiress, that sounds so cool! This movie is set in South Carolina, such a beautiful place! It is! It adds to the romance of the film. Awww Noah writes Allie letters every day for a year, how sweet! There is a scene where they kiss in the rain. It has become an iconic scene. I can see that, South Carolina is very romantic.
Hello La la land huh what do you think I'm not too sure about this movie. I like Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone but if it's another dance-music movie, I'm over them. lmao TOTALLY I didn't bother watching it I tried but, i wasn't connecting My husband just traveled to Los Angeles and keeps going on about how great it is. I am not a fan of that either Oh wow, that's a surprise. I thought everyone expect me liked it Have you been there? NO The reviews on this movie are very opposing Yeah I guess that why it made all those awards, because it's a showbiz story Who listens to Jazz anymore? lol, I dont know. It's so old I didnt knw john legend was in the movie Seriously I tried watching this movie, I couldn't get thorugh it The last time I heard a character named Sebastian was the Cruel Intentions movie I'm not much of a movie person but I thought this one might be good until I heard that it's got music and dancing. Just not my thing Lol that was Ryan Philipe the ratings to this movie is really high though it's in the 90s Was it supposed to be a christmas movie? They mention christmas songs. no its like a showbiz struggle movie That might have made it better. ;) And then I has a romantic twist to it too It would be hard to be putting pressure on the person you are dating to find work if they are not happy with what they are doing. Seems like the classic, love, fight, chase each other around the world type of movie Do you watch movie of such high ratings or you vary I actually don't pay attention to ratings. I'll watch it if the previews get me interested. I don't even remember the previews for this one yeah me to What generes do you like genres Usually drama and comedy. My husband forces me to watch sci-fi so I occasionally get sucked into those too. this is a muscial, you like muscial s
maybe ! its hard though ! i do all the shopping and i love pork ! oh man ! thatll be hard to give up . my gf loves it too !
That sounds intense. Why do the Chitauri want the teseract? Because it is a powerful energy source with an immeasurable power. It opens wormholes among space and planets, allowing Loki, and the Chitauri to go where they want and have immense power hopping to the wormhole allowing the Chitauri to immerge on Earth. Oh. That makes sense. So is Loki from Earth? Or is he from another planet? Loki and Thor are from Asgard. Another dimension of the sorts. Ok. So there's other planets and dimensions in this movie. Sounds like Sci Fi. Would you say it's more Sci fi or Fantasy? Or a different genre?
lets go to canada together . just do not eat seafood near me . i am not really a fan of seafood either it makes me not breathe well and sometimes my eyeballs fallout . oh wow ! ! ! that is awful i know it hurts a lot . when can we go to canada ? i am ready when you are . just got to pack my suitcase lol re you looking for a husband ? maybe . are you looking for a wife ? yes i need a wife that will drink hot chocolate with me during winter .

Typical. Parents get in the way. Hijinks can't ensue if there are parents around to say "That's a bad idea" my mom's favorite line "no more shenanigans!" Han's was such a jerk! Like, if there had been a dad or mom here they would have said, "Everybody calm down. There are no monsters here." yes, he was! I can't believe Anna fell for his antics I can. It's the first person her own age she's seen in years who is actually interested in her. hm, i suppose that's true.  she needed more playdates growing up. She had no friends after her parents died the only people she saw were the servants and Elsa. I always wondered what happened to Kristoff's parents. And why did he have a reindeer? What happened to Sven's parents?
hat sounds good , as long as it does not mess up my red shoes . i could play you a song
what do you do for a living ? i am a teacher , special ed teacher .
I mean, they have both Lois Lane and Martha Kent. As far as actors though, I'm so bad with names, I only really know the people in this movie Oh okay. I haven't any clue of female actors who would be good.
i have a huge appetite , a hard job . i cut down trees , eat pancakes and 44 grandparent , dragons are awesome , prefer night but love the sun lright ! that is a mouthful . how many grandchildren ?
it definitely would be , yeah . do you have a significant other ? i do but we do not live together . i easily fall in and out of love . i guess i am philanthropic .
I might check into it
I think those ratings are based on current critics. It would be interest to see if they were based on critic scores from 1990. I felt the score is fine. The film was a fun adventure with little depth to it.
llo there ! how are you doing today ? so far so good . i just finished eating dessert . how about you ? y children just left . i am currently in a retirement home . do they serve blue jello there ? ry to avoid all that . i actually bake a lot . grandson loves chocolate cake mmmm i like chocolate anything . ll . my whole family has red hair . what about yours ? ow cool ! all black hair . my grandchildren are now doing ombre hairstyles i work from home . what type of work did you do before you retired ? i was an interior designer in ny . i still wish i could do that have you looked into anything online and do you have quick recipe for asparagus soup ?

chnology is the blueprint of everlasting life , the proof that life goes on forever .
the person playing gordon also did a good job, being one of really few honest cop in gotham that city was very corrupt

I hope he does. I need to see him in a stand alone movie. I know he can do the part. It's just a matter of getting a good story. Something that he can work with and hopefully something we haven't seen before. I like the idea of an older world weary Batman. I agree, I am curious to see who he would go against in a stand alone movie.  I would like them to kind of focus on that suit with the haha all over it and kind of see what happened. Did you feel like the actor who played superman did a good job?
now that I read all this the plot is intriguing, despite od beeing a teen movie I decided I barely remember watching it I wouldn't exactly call it "comic gold" like one of the critics I just remember it being OK It seems revenge was the main focus after all I was also surprised when I saw the Rotten Tomatoes score it is rather high for a teen girl comedy so, if it comes on netflix I may watch it again my wife would probably call me a pervert though it kinda has a plot twist what is the plot twist? IMO the way that the protagonist treats her colleagues after all meaning cady/lohan? she respects them yep she is kinda the main character/hero of the movie so she has to come out looking good and un-petty yeah but it is a hard situation to face in real life it came out in 2004? I am gettting old ow so long... couldn't remenber how old it was it seems inda recent it sure does lohan hasnt aged well :D rachel mcadams has though I dont think lacey chabert has been in anything else since could it have an american dream message in this movie? I think you are looking deeper than you should in this movie it's no Godfather or Citizen Kane
Yes. And the Rotten Tomatoes score is 100%. Great, it really does sound like it is a great movie. Have they made sequels to this film? Maybe you can check online but this film got people to understand what toys are about. How did the film tell you what toys are about? As in, what do you think toys are about? When buzz impresses Andy, Woody feels left out. Woody attempts to trap Buzz, but knocks him out of a window. Interestingly, Buzz thinks he's a real space ranger and Woody tries to convince him otherwise. That sounds action-packed. Do you think children give their toys personalities like we give our pets personalities? I'm not sure, but in this movie Woody fears Andy will choose Buzz over him.
rough because of personality clashes or what? Yes Iron Man has a hard time working with the other teammates. They all have strong personalities which makes it a little hard at first. Also Loki does his best to divide them. that makes sense, speaking of loki, is that hard for thor to fight his brother? oh it looks like we can finish the conversation, thank you so much for telling me about the movie!
i wish i could do better like learning another language you should learn french . it is the most romantic . my lifestyle is boring right now when i am bored , i draw . the ladies love an artist . are you male or female ? i am to learn new cultures . i am a male come to france ! no better way to learn new cultures than travel .
ood dogs . now about me i have dark , curly hair and blue eyes . oh , i am older . i listen to sinatra .
i suppose it is not for everyone It also sags badly in the middle I like how Sebastian slipped into a passionate jazz despite warnings from the owner. what do you think of the cover of "i ran so far away?" in the movie, sebastian found the song an insult for a serious musician I don't know, it is considered an insult for serious musicians not sure why yeah The idea of a one woman play was daring it was interesting how sebastian joined a jazz fusion band he couldnt find real happiness in any of the bands he was in its hard It is considering she didn't know of any of that until she attended one of his concerts yeah, that is daring the movie kind of speaks to a lot of people. she accussed him of abandoning his dreams but sometimes thats what you have to do. Not nice that she leaves because he told her she liked him better when he was unsuccessful The play was a disaster so he didn't miss anything when he missed it. yeah, but i dont blame her for dumping him for that She should didn't want to support him and she had to move back id be pretty upset as well to boulder city nevada yes she didn't want to forgive him, I didn't understand that well because that was a big deal to her and he missed it if she was with him when he was unsuccessful, she could have supported him to follow his dreams or other dreams i suppose that is true she wasn't successful either
i didnt realize that Livvy Stubenrauch was the voice of 5 year old Anna. What did you think of the Elsa charactore I did not know that! Elsa was great, Frozen was the biggest success Disney has had since the death of Howard Ashman. He did Little Mermaid and Beuty and the beast I figured it made a huge amount of money from it.  The fact that the craze has lasted for several years shows it success. I loved both of those movies. You know its now a Broadway play? No I did not realize that It will be a big part of Disneys modern legacy. It probably rank up there with the Lion King on Broadway I think its just terrific family entertainment. Yes it is.  I like that it shows how to reconnect as a family Did you think the story lagged on its way to conclusion? At time I think it did.  I think the whole Olaf summer song was simply filler and could have been left out or replaced with a different scene. Those songs are definetly in the style of Broadway, I rather liked them. This is only song in the entire movie that I just didn't love. I think it was a declaration of Disney's renewed cultural relevance. I loved the trolls who healed Anna.
Oh!, I liked also the Mustang that starts the second scene Also, highly recognizable, that's a plothole in my opinion yeah so many nice cars, reminds me of fast and furious that is a good scene they are refering to, when Aurelio tells him something like john wick is the boogeyman or something lol I liked that , by the way of the Mustang stealing, it gets establshed the previous story of Jhon Wick as a top assassin. yeah it would be nice if they came out with a pre sequel, is that a prelude? like showing him in his past days and his wife
hello , i am doing very well now that it is lunch time for the students . re you a school teacher i am , and i go home to two more , and several fur kids . www that is cute do you like music i do . mainly metal and classical . what do you listen to ? i like rap when i am smoking weed i think that would help my autistic son , but medical marijuana is not legal here . hat is too bad it helps me relax after my boring job we have tried everything for him , i know it has helped a lot of people . yeah i bet it would be beneficial what do you do for a living ? i work as an it tech

I wish i could make 22 million in 3 hours, legally of course. THough they went the illegal route He went through a lot of trouble to hide all that cash True but when you're dealing with that much $, the line between legal and illegal gets very blurry. Just depends on if you get caught. Yeah, the tax man is the public enemy #1, these guys will anything to avoid taxes lol. Thats true, they def brought attention on themselves with that one
I do like sports.  What else can you tell me about it? The cast are Sandra Bullock Tim McGraw Quinton Aaron Sandra Bullock is a good actress.  I enjoy her. It is a drama and about being adopted Ok.  I sometimes like dramas, if I'm in the right mood. The film received a lot of positive reviews and critics praising Sandra for her performance This is a christian movie to Awesome.  I find that I enjoy movies more if they get good reviews. The director is John Lee Hamcock and he can make some good movies I'm not sure if I've ever seen any of his movies or not. Michael has been in and out of foster car he is the main charector. because his mother has been doing drugs.He runs away a lot every time he is placed in a new home
ybe , i can get that from mcdonalds ! i eat there every night . do you like being outside ? i hike . o , it is too dirty ! where do you hike ? in new zealand . someday my photographs will be in an adam levin video . oals ! ! that just sounds like exhausting work . i am tired thinking about it . i think with enough coffee and booze anything is possible so very true . i think adam levin should be in so many movies . i actually do not know about that . i want amy adams in more movies . she is good too . hey , do you have a drinking problem ?
I'm doing fantastic! :<o> And you? Great! Do you like superheros? Definitely, Batman is my fave. Well, this isn't Batman, but it's still pretty good. It's Wonder Woman! OMG She is great And its directed by Patty Jenkins, a very reputable person. Who is playing the role of Wonder Woman?
oh . are you in a relationship ?
okay vegan dishes , and no tacos . i cant stand tortillas .
Some critical responses are "is true to the spirit of [Monsters, Inc.] and matches its tone. But it never seems content toturn over old ground." "It has enough of the right stuff to haunt the imagination long after the immediate buzz ofits fluffy-furred cuteness has melted away. For a mere prequel, that's a result." "is cute, and funny, and the animation, though not exactly inspired, is certainly colorful." great great
well if you ever need any kind of design advice for that , let me know
anthony mackie was cuba goodings replacement in iron man and then he became hawkeye i think? That's a decent cast so yeah decent cast for a rock em sock em robots movie i would love to see those animatronics Scores are okay on the review sites too Yeah, robots fighting n that scale would be cool a big of disparity though 59% on one True, two scores around 55-60% and the other an A And then cinema score A? clearly different strokes also, its set in 2020, not far away, i cant wait for robot ufc! Haha me too!! World Robot Boxing, I like the sound of that! Classic script, dad and kid fight all odds to take on the big boss at the end its just a hop and a skip away from a smaller version of pacific rim does the robot have ai or does he control it? A lot of sports movies follow that framework I reckon I think he tells the robot what to do, or else controls it with a joystick kid of thing

I have to admit,I liked the twist at the end of who the villain really was. I totally missed that. Casting there was really good too.  He was not your typical Strong type of villain either. Haha yeah .I didn't like the villain too much though. He was too underplayed. I didn't really read the comics, but was Wonder Woman always the daughter of Zeus? Or was that unique only to the film universe? the notes say that she is the half sibling of Ares and daughter of Hippolyta and Zues.. i do not remember that being in the tv show, but i did not read the comics either. I only remember she was an Amazonian.

Of course, Its a Superhero movie directed by Zack Snyder, Staring Ben Affleck and Henry Cavill. Its set in the DC universe and is the second installment in their attempt to make a joint universe. The plot follows the two main characters as they attempt to sort out their different views on the man of steel himself. You should really see it.
yeah is a pulitzer prize winning book .

hat is nice . its good to have a physical outlet . what are your hobbies ?
Yeah, even though I love comedies, this wasn't 1 of my faves how come. thought tina fey's writing was fantastic in it. she did an amazing job adapting a self help book I loved the story & how true they made it in how  teen girls act but I honestly don't know why I didn't rate it highly as all the right ingredients were there. I cannot believe it was 2004 it was released though, 14 years ago! I see. i didn't realize it was 14 years ago. you're right. Man. now I feel old. i remember seeing this in the theaters. i guess you disagree that it's one of top 50 teen comedies, at least according to rotten tomatoes I suppose it's just all about personal preference, my favourite American comedy films include anything with Will Ferrol & Seth Rogan so more slapstick films. I'm sure this was the movie that made Lindsay Lohan huge even though she had starred in movies from her early years This was one of lindsay lohan's bigger successes. it made her very well known. although i think it made amanda seyfried well known too. she was so pretty in this film. it made a fan out of me.
at the start it was him as a child he fell in to the well and was scared by bats Ok Being scared by bats triggered something within negatively? yes a little later his parents was killed at the movies and he was raised by his butler alfred Wow.. no wondered it was a darker side of him. i think that is what happens at the start of most batman series this one is sad because he tries to train to kill the guy but someone kills him first So Batman died? the robber Ok. So what else happens after that? so bruce or batman travels the world to learn how to fight crime So he is fighting? Anyone trying to take over? and train with a guy who turns out to be a a crimal and so bruce burns down the place he was traing at and kills the guy so far do you think that this is a movie you would like to see? Yeah It does sounds very interesting i don't like spoiling the whole plot thanks for the chat You are welcome
i thought he had a  good attitude with the role. didnt really show up much in the movie but it wasnt about him. i feel like he was always happy but they needed to have realistic roles of getting angry
i hear you . i ran grom aliens once . great exercise i like to take my dogs out with me sometimes . do you have any dogs ? o i do not . what kinds of dogs do you have wo great danes and a yorkie i love yorkies . ever been to new york ? that is where i am from ope but i would love to visit .

I can't honestly say, however, as a critic noted "it's better than Man of Steel but not as good as The Dark Knight". Who are the lead actors? It follows 2013's Man of Steel so you would probably need to see it just to be safe... Batman, Superman and even wonder woman makes an appearance! Haha! Do you know which actors play Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman in this movie? Ben Affleck plays Batman/Bruce Wayne, Henry Cavill plays Clark Kent/Superman. Gal Gadot stars in the film as well as Diane Lane as Martha Kent and Amy Adams as Louis Lane. Are you a fan of any of those actors? All but Ben Affleck. Lest super hero movie I saw him in was Daredevil and that was rough. Let's hope he's better in this. Though, I am a Michael Keaton fan when it comes to Batman. I suspect anyone playing Batman who is not Keaton will be weird to me. Most of the critics wasn't too fond of it, but CinemaScore have it a rating of B, which I feel is about right for this film! Have you seen it? I have and would grade it a solid B, just as CinemaScore did. Are you a fan of director Zack Snyder? I'm not sure. What other movies has he directed? He directed Batman vs Superman. The film takes place 18 months after the battle between General Zod and Superman. Superman becomes a controversial figure while Clark Kent learns of Batman's form of justice and seeks to expose him via Daily Planet articles. Has he directed anything else besides the Batman or Superman movies? I can't honestly say. I know he directed this film while David S. Goyer and Chris Terrio cowrote it. Batman and Superman are enemies in this film?
yea he is! in this move he t Was it a long movie
Did you like the cast? I can't believe this movie is already 28 years old Do you think Culkin did a good job in the movie? For sure.  Being as young as he was, he did a good job. it is true that it has a long time, how fast time passes I also liked Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern as the wet bandits I think you got very low score on the rotten tomatoes 62% is very little I just saw that, seems pretty low for a movie that is always on TV

yea she did not do much to change the character. just i am a princess here i am i for got about the beginning when he cuts her wings off it has been a while since i have seen it I think they should have picked someone else, but I don't know who That was a little different way to start the movie When Aurora is fifteen, she encounters Maleficent. Knowingthat she is being watched over, she calls Maleficent her "fairy godmother." i dont remember that part. i might need to watch it again It's hard to remember all the parts! It was good enough to see twice though. yes i think i will try to watch this one again I have to admit.  I laughed at the name Knotgrass.

Things like that made the movie seem far more realistic than it really was. Kinda cool since it was an animated movie for kids I also thought it was a little touching, even for such a silly movie where the girls offered their piggy bank.
Yes i agree it had a very strong cast of actors. Definitely a good revival of the franchise the actor christian Bale palyed batman verywell!! yes Even the supporting actors were great I liked Gary Oldman and Michael Caine. Even Liam Neeson had a good roll yes i like liam nesson alot!! Even the critics seemed to give it rave reviews i think the ratings should be higher then 7.7 i would give it 10.0 true I think that they were about right with the ratings. Some of the scenes were slow. But everything in the movie was necessary yes the movie hade everything you could ask for in it but i still feel it should hade gotting a better rating in what year dide it come out? It was nice to see the back story of how he became batman. It was released in 2005 as the first batman directed by Christopher nolan yea wish more movies come out with him in it with who in it? Christopher nolan ;] hes sexy ;] He just directed it. Did not have roll in the movie otherwise yes but he directes movies very well\ i like him alote and his movies Thats very true. What did you think of the scene where Raz A Gul was training batman i think it was great even later he hadeto fight him what do you think about Bruce wayne phobia of bats ? Did you think that batman used personal motives when he fought? Like making sure Rachel was safe? I think that he had a valid reason to be afraid of them. yes i do think so you? Being a child and falling into a well where you felt like you were being attacked by them would taumatize most kids. yea true but not me iv seen a real ghost in person I think that he did let alot of his personal motives show in this movie. Specifically making sure that Rachel was safe as she was a love interest
its going good thank you
i like listening to music with saxophone solos . i also try to workout several times a week to stay healthy and in shape ! hat is awesome . i usually just curl up at home by the fire and listen to some jazz i have a bunch of friends and can be super social with them ! i like looking at little dolls from the victorian era . their outfits are beautiful . whats for dinner tonight ? i am making spaghetti right now ! ybe some wine . just a dinner for two . hat sounds like it could be a nice evening !

It's definitely a good coming of age movie. The boy has to become a man by killing a dragon, but he becomes friends with the dragon and doesnt want to kill it Cool, sounds like an interesting story. They were definitely trying to promote a message of not being blindly forced into a way of life/culture, just because the older men thought that way He ends up convincing the others to live in harmony with the dragons instead of killing them The battle scenes are really cool, the animation was great for that movie I didn't know that it was the same people who made Lilo & Stitch
what do you do for fun i like to run . i stay busy taking care of my parents . hat is nice that you will help your parents out . i read and make stuff with beads oh . do you have any siblings ? o i am the only child sometimes i wish i had a brother

i reside close to michigan right next to grand rapids .
That's an action film right? It seems so good! I bet there are all sorts of characters in it and funny ones too. Ya it has Robert Downey Jr in it He is a great actor. Have you seen it before? The plot is pretty interesting, Ya once when it came out in 2012 Tell me a little about the plot. A lot of stuff about aliens and SHIELD, then the Avengers have to come together to save the planet. Typical Marvel I love stuff about aliens! Marvel always seems to have alien stuff in their movies. Haha Loki is a great one he's the villan and he's Thor's brother, so there's a whole family dynamic Wow, so a good brother and a bad brother. Like kane and abel. haha just like, but less stabbing Still just as dramatic! Some of the main scenes have Nike Shield, Samuel L Jackson, trying to get everyone together Samuel L Jackson is great. They find alien artifacts with weird energy signaturs He always has a serious look. That sounds mysterious. He should do more romcoms. Then Toni Stark, Shield and the Avengers have to save the day. Yeah, they are all great.
I have seen it. You mean the 2010 biographical drama directed by David Fincher, about the founding of Facebook, right? Yes, the one directed by David Fincher. It was a pretty good movie, it has a CinemaScort rating of a B+ Yea, I wasn't sure how it would turn out, but Jesse Eisenberg (who played Mark Zuckerberg) did a great job. Although I find it odd that Zuckerburg himself (nor Facebook staff) were involved with the project. I did too. But, there was several celebrities in it, like Justin Timberlake, he played Sean Parker in the movie. The movie was released to the United States by Columbia Pictures. Amie Hammer played two characters in this movie, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss. I bet that was challenging. I'm sure it did. And I thought Timberlake was great in his role as well. The film takes liberties with the subject matter, and Aaron Sorkin based his screenplay on the book "The Accidental Billionaires." Not sure how much of it is actually factual, but it's certainly enjoyable. It has a few critical responses but it what said that this was the movie of the year. They say that Fincher and Sorkin takes this even further then that. Yea the critical response so far has been very positive. It received a 96% on Rotten Tomatoes and a Metacritic Score of 95/100. And I have to say it definitely deserves it. I agree, it does. Very good movie and I enjoyed the actors in it as well. It is said that not only does the movie portray Facebook, it also portrays the lawsuits as well. I learned some things that I didn't know before I watched it. Yea, it really defined the dark irony of the past decade. The scathing wit of the film is laced with an aching sadness. I was surprised to find out that Mark Zuckerberg got 6 months of academic probation for hacking into the college databases. Yea turned out to be a blessing in disguise though. Remember how Facemash's popularity attracted the attention of Harvard upperclassmen (and twins) Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss and their business partner Divya Narendra? And then they invite Zuckerberg to work on Harvard Connection (a social network for Harvard students aimed at dating).
i love driving my mercedes dangerously fast haha . . . you ? oh better be careful . i am a pro basketball player like nba pro ? i do not watch much but that is bad a ! yeah i was drafted by the t wolves i dunk things only think i am dunking is dunkaroos . but yeah . . . congrats on that ! where di you go to college ? small community college here . nothing fancy i went to unc . we had a cheating scandal

And his first iron man film plants the seed of him feeling the responsibility of the power he has and can do Oh so hes just coming to understand the capabilities of his power in this film.? he had to make the suit to get out of a situation he put himself in the movie came out in 2008 Is that the crux of the story line? his abilities are tied to the suit he makes Theres aways a bad guy or villian. Good vs evil type narrative going on right? the crux being the weapons he developed and sold were being used for bad things Ok got it. So he invents things but then the wrong type of people are after his inventions? yea but at first he didnt care becuase for stark that's how he made money And thats the way of the world actually! yup
very true. That bigass metal iron man villian was pretty cooltoo i remember that! the ending was the best when he's like "im iron man"and everyone goes "woahhhh" I believe that is when his buddy was in the other suit too- if i'm remember correctly been a while since i seen it. same. I saw it when it came out My oldest loves these movies, he probably know it like the back of his hand lol I didn't see the sequals tho, people said they wern't very good I didn't realize gwneth paltrow was in in i knew he had a girlfriend in the movie, just didn't know that was her lol Well, it wasnt really his gf my son seen all of them, i dont remember much of any of them. "love interest" iron man is a pimp

I thought she did a great job. Loved Chris Pine as well (and I'm honestly not a big fan of his either). Patty Jenkins did a great job directing it! I didn't think Gadot would be able to pull off the role, but I was surprisingly wrong. I am not a fan of Pine either. As for the director she made a good impression considering I've never heard of her. I think the story setting was done properly, not too much deviation from the comic books which I liked a lot. What did you think of the story? Same here. I hadn't heard of her either. I liked ththe story. I honestly wasn't familiar with the comic but never would have guessed her backstory took place during a World War. What did you think of it - story wise!
Why do they harvest the screams? I am not really sure why they do that. Okay.  Are there any more famous names I might recognize in the movie?
ok be there in a minute . i am hungry now . what kind of food do you like ? i just said it i love spicy food asian food will be my top choice and you ?
I don't see a paragraph about a movie. Is anyone else in here? Hi! Have you seen the movie The Imitation Game? I haven't. What's that about? It's a 2014 American historical drama about real life cryptoanalyst Alan Turing. Do you like biopics? If you do this movie might interest you. It sounds interesting. What does Alan Turing do? He decrypted German Intelligence codes for the British government during WWII. It has 91% rating on Rotten Tomatoes and average 7.7/10 and a Metacritic Score of 73/100. What ratings does a movie have to have for you to watch it? Or do you not consider ratings when deciding to watcha movie?
yeah , i am having a hard time choosing between lollipops and rainbows well you can try electronic music
i love whiskey . i host amazing parties .
Wow, that's intense. Was there a specific reason why he defied his boss? Was he trying to impress the girl? He just loves jazz that much and he wants to pursue his dream at any cost.  He actually brushes off Mia (Stone) when she attempts to compliment him after he is fired. So it isn't about the girl at all and he is really passionate about his music. Does it say where love interest comes into play? Well, there is inevitable chemistry between the two main characters.  You first see it when Mia runs into Sebastian at a party where he is playing in a 1980s pop cover band. I see. So it seems that the musical is set in the past but not too distant. Was the movie nominated for any awards? It was, but we were just getting to the most interesting part of the plot!  Inspired by Sebastian's commitment to his dream of becoming a jazz performer, Mia writes a one-woman play.

You are right, another proof is the re-opening of the beaches after they caught the tiger shark. Even if there was no human remains in it. Yes, he was quick to assume that was the shark w/o considering there are more sharks in the ocean. Do you like thriller movies like Jaws? Yeah, I like the fact that is really efficient. How do you appreciate Spielberg work in this film ?
Yes, in a way it's a little like Matrix, but with a lot of levels. If you liked Matrix you would probably like Inception.

yes indeed, the characters are very engaging.  And Tom Hanks voice It's also really interesting to note how far the graphics have evolved since the time of this movie. I remember being amazed at the time, but retroactively looking back it has aged pretty harshly.  The voice acting like you mentioned is still top notch though. yes indeed.  Definitely was more intriguing at a younger age forgot about Tim Allen being the voice for Buzz Lightyear It's pretty interesting that "Slinky Dog" was also supposed to be a dachshund...I guess it makes sense looking back but at the time I just though generic dog... It looks like they have given us a bit more information now. threw al the toys off by moving the party up a week Have you ever thought about how odd it is that Buzz thinks he is a real person, but instinctively turned into a toy when a child came near? yeah good point maybe a "natural instinct" I guess it is suppose to be sort of like that, a natural instict And then there is Buzz being the showoff.  not a good impression on the others But it was crucial to show character development. Oh, I also remember how Sid was such a horrifying character... Or at least the toys in his house.

Yeah, no, I'm no fan of either, either. But it was that scene that kind said everything that needed to be said about the mentality behind that site. I thought that was pretty brilliant. it seems to be highly rated Yeah. It's definitely a strong movie. I mean, it's a movie about Facebook that is actually watchable. That's saying something. yes Iwas thinking that as well it is even more trajic where it has brought us politically For sure. And I feel like it's all in that bit where Sean Parker has his line about "You know what IS cool? A billion dollars." Like, it's presented as a way to keep people in touch, but it's really the coldest corporate-type of thing. yes greed is powerfull Did you know Sean Parker was the founder of Napster? yes it is interesting how he suggested getting rid of "the" Yes! I was just about to say that. I think it's crazy how much influence he had on Facebook when it started out. Then there's that last scene, where Zuckerberg keeps refreshing his page to see if his ex-girlfriend has accepted his friend request. That's what it all comes back to. After all the greed, you've still got these human needs. it is interesting for sure it would be funny if it was still called facemash I know, that was a pretty weird name. Even 'Facebook' seemed weird back in the day.
veryone makes fun of me when i try to whistle . i just cannot do it !
would you say that you are an organized or messy person in general ? i tend to be organized in my work , but cluttered at home . i would say i am very organized at home and at work . do you enjoy shopping ?
How dd you fee about the scene listed? The one about the fight between Hiccup and Night Fury? Yes, i feel like the setting helped the plot, the 3D animations were some of the best I like that part. The dragon had a really interesting look as well. Who do you think is the protagonist? I'd say it's definitely Hiccup Do you feel like the reviews reflect the movie? How did scene #2 make you feel? I think the critical response was a little awkward, but the ratings were spot on. You? I tend to not look at ratings when chossing a movie to watch. But i feel like they were reflective of the content I don't think the description for scene 2 really captures how good it was I hear ya
she does ! what do you do for fun ?
usa . and you ? i am in cali . . . u ?

yeah, I would give it around 80% or less it's decent, but it's not great Iron Man is a 2008 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Paramount Pictures. I mean, come on! The Dark Knight has 98% hahahaha I know that' way to high. Cast Rober Downy Jr. as Tony Stark/Iron Man that was a perfect casting choice, to be honest Tony Stark a billionaire who inherited the defense contractor in Afghanistan. Critical Response "expansively entertaining special effects extravaganza" with "fresh engery and stylistics polish". Did you watch the 2nd and 3rd film as well? I watched the 2nd one only TBH I only watched the first one.
ok thats good to know they were actually high rotten tomatoes is 62% that is pretty low, dont you think so its in middle i guess so in my opinion if its not over 75% its not too good but i liked the movie i think it deserves a 85% i mean they made so many movies yeah critics rate things weird they did Culkin was a good actor it was a first for the type of movie not bad for a kid i dont think they had other types of movies like that before yea i agree i dont think so either he is weird now yea i think he had drug problems yup they all do he isnt in any recent movies right nope he is far gone yeah i guess people kind of dont like him anymore i see bye I guess he was better as a kid ok talk to you later
what type of ebooks do you read ?
Yeah he gets invovled with drugs and ripping people off ohh i see He hires his neighbour and they found their own firm selling crappy stocks to poor people he starts selling drugs? oh ok No just doing drugs when did the movie come out? They do an IPO for Steve Madden, but it was actually a pump and dump scam and they make $22 million in 3 hours It came out in 2013 damn that's a lot of money for 3 hours than they were good Yeah I wouldn't be mad beside the ripping people off But the FBI arrests Leo eventually And he has to wear a wire and rat on his friends haha you gave away the ending but still would be interesting to watch it how it develops is it based on real facts? Yeah its really fun and pretty funny You should definitely watch it i will, thank you nice talking to you thanks for telling me about the movie Hey no problem any time bye
hi there how are you ? i am good what do you like to eat i am well preparing my favorite meal , an you ? i love to check out new restaurants i love mushroom ravioli with a garlic sauce , going to paris soon . hat sounds delicious do you go often i am fluent in french , going to look for my dad . www that is sweet have you visited him before o this will be a first , me an him have never met . i think that is why wow how did you track him down i have not , just his mom , my mom will not tell me much . bankers . lol hat is funny i am a banker too lol yea she is something else , i work in a shelter for animals . hat is nice do you have any pets

Have you watched "The Avengers" from 2012? I have watched this movie> The one with Mark ruffalo as the Hulk? I personally feel this is a better Hulk than the first Hulk move with Eric Bana as the hulk. i didnt like tha tmovie did you like this movie? (the avengers with 2012)? I am in agreement with you. I did not like Eric Bana as the hulk. I think Mark Ruffalo does a much better job at playing the part of the Hulk Yes I like this movie quite a bit absolutely. I feel that the bana version of the hulk was way too emotional. the whole movie he was crying about "wah wah im the hulk"....like he was lamenting it...heck if i were the hulk id be excited and say "hell yeah im the hulk , let me smash some stufff. " hahaha but thats just me. i like my superheroes to have some badassery to them lol What was the best part of Avengers in your opinion? the last part where they are eating the schwarma at the end of the movie lol I like my super heroes to have depth and character Do you think Robert Downey Jr. does another great job as Tony Stark/Iron Man i think so. he does a good job. i can't see anyone else playing tony stark/Ironman What is the Scharma? Schwarma its that food they are eating at the end of the movie after the credits I dont think i saw this during the fight scene tony stark talks about this great schwarma place they need to try nearby ...so after the credits they show them eating there in silence and someone says yeah this is great lol how does it pertain to the Avengers? its funny its just a funny thing at the end of the movie lol that makes sense, a blooper so to speak all the superhero movies have some sort of thing at the end What will be the next super hero movie to be released do you think? Black Panther just came out today I wasnt aware of that, who is in it im not sure. but im sure its going to be a hit

ice . my moms a music teacher in the high school . hat is great ! although go carts is my thing to do .
That's the thing about thrillers though, we get the thrill factor we are looking for! Especially when it came to Jaws. Yes I agree and Steven Spielberg is amazing at bringing our fears to life Most filmmakers lack in talent when compared to Steven Spielberg, that's for sure. Steven Spielberg is pretty much the best at thrillers I look forward to seeing any movie that he is connected to Roy Scheider was perfect for his role as Chief Martin Brody I totally agree. I couldn't imagine anyone else playing Martin. Roy Scheider gave the audience sheer terror in his eyes and that made the movie I can't imagine anyone else playing that character Neither could I . I would have been frightened seeing someone's partial remains on the beach. The movie started off with a bang so to speak the first attack was pretty much almost immediate which is another reason that the movie itself was so terrifying From the first attack the audience was hooked to see what else would happen but afraid to know at the same time When everyone learned about the shark attack, I would have put as much money that I could afford to hire a bounty hunter for sharks to! the makings of a perfectly executed thriller I know the first thought would have been to hire a hunter or hunters to take the shark out of the water The beach was basically useless with the shark attacks happening. I wouldn't have dared to back until I knew the waters were safe. the attacks happened so rapidly and suddenly without warning it was terrifying to imagine I agree I would have been done with the beach at that point And then for them to find a shark tooth in a human skull?? That is terrifying. they continued to go to the beach even with the warnings, with every thing they saw including the skull they continued they were fighting against the sharks natural flow

HAHA I don't think so but it's got Princess Aurora and the fairies who take her to hide her from maleficent but in this one its from maleficent's side hmm maybe that was another one of those disney remakes they have done in the last couple years yeah kind of - it's very dark and to me goes away too far from the original What kind of info did you receive in the document? Was it just a summary of the movie? I have key scenes, the cast, genre and then an intro there's also a part that says Maleficent demolishes stereotypes that were only tweaked in frozen... I'm happy to say I have been able to avoid seeing frozen hahahaha I have a niece who loves it so I did not get so lucky Did you see this Maleficent movie in theaters? no i watched it later on- I didn't want to watch because I'm a fan of the original now had they left it the regular story but made it live action like beauty and the beast i'd have been ok with that

very . i have an hour long commute , on a good day . hat is hard work , do you travel ? i want to go to uk i do , i travel a lot for work , currently preparing for a trip to china . oh that will be an adventure . do you have hobbies ?
i am a third shift security guard , just finished training . ! i am training to get my pilots license currently . hat is awesome ! i am 30 , so its time i did something with my life .
it was the first ever feature film that was 100% computer animated! whatttt!! i am not as informed as i thought i was haha my document really helped me i also think im still mixing deamworks/pixar that's awesome we learn something new everyday

i am 29 . i have a couple of room mates too . do you live a lone ? hat is interesting . do you like them ? yes , i live alone , thankfully . yeah they are just fine
Do you like comedies? cinema score has a rating of A which is odd since the other sites say its a lower mid rated movie daniel stern is marv joe pesci's partner in this movie I dont think I have seen anything else with Chris Columus? What else did he direct? This is a christmas movie and has a lost boy subject of the movie Do you agree with the ratings the movie got? They say the film is flat but if someone believes that then they have no sense of humor and probably shouldnt be doihng movie reviews
y brother does not paint his nails either . he is like a viking . wow yeah vikings do not strike me as ones to like painting their nails ope haha . my pet skunk is currently running around .
Yes, I really liked him.  I never would have thought of him as a super hero before his Iron Man role though. Me either!!  In reading the reviews it looks like it has some comedy in it.  Is that true? It looks like, according to the quotes.  Doney is very funny sometimes, as is Joss Whedon's writing. I never thought of watching this movie, superhero movies turn me off, but this sounds like one I might like considering the cast and the humor, I generally put a lot of trust in the Rotten Tomatoes website, and they gave it a 92%.  I'm sure it must be good. I'm really impressed with the list of actors. It's a pretty large cast too.  Looks like lots of complex characters. Do you know who plays Nick Fury, the character who recruits the Agengers? The document doesn't say, but it does mention Samuel L. Jackson as a cast member.  I wonder if it's him. That kinda makes sense, but he can be pretty evil too. That's true.  I bet Johansson looks great as the Black Widow. Have you seen any of the other Marvel movies?? A couple.  I saw the first two Iron Man movies. I can't believe this came out in 2012, that seems so long ago. I wonder what S.H.I.E.L.D. is an acronym for. Hmmm, I don't know, but it says it's a fighter jet from the other side. Interesting.  I used to like reading about Norse mythology.  Thor and Loki should be interesting.
lol . coupons are such a great way to save , especially if they double them yes , they are . my last guitar was paid for by the money i saved using coupons .

Keanu Reeves Is there anyone else in it? Who co-stars in it? Michael Nyquist, Alfie Allen, Adrianne Palicki, Bridget Moynahan, Dean Winters, Ian McShane, John Leguizamo, and Willem Dafoe What is this movie about? An Ex-hitman who return to the criminal underworld following the death of his wife What is this movie rated? it's rated R What did you like most about this movie? I loved the action scenes.  How one man takes down a group of heavily armed individuals without a weapon, so good! Are the reviews for this movie good? They are mixed, Rotten tomatoes gave it an 86% and Cinema score gave it a B Do you think I should watch it?
what keeps you so busy ? as an athlete i spend my time at the gym . i work very long hours
That's true, and it probably also has a lot to do with the types of humor people like, or don't care for. Yeah, that's true. But, of course, most watch it for the thrill. For example, there is a scene in the movie where a woman named Chrissie Watkins goes skinny dipping in the ocean. While she's in the water, she's suddenly pulled under! It's unexpected and thrilling, one of the reasons why I enjoy this movie. I honestly don't know what else to say...... This has been going on way too long and is honestly silly. I'm going to return the HIT. Hopefully you can abort the conversation and still get paid. This is terrible
Sorry, just giving information to help No problem The story goes on about the problems that Michael faces. How he can't understand why Leigh Anne took him in and is so supportive of him That would be a soul searching quest on Michael's part.  I can understand the questioning.  Did he ever really feel accepted? It really is a good movie and I am not doing it any justice. You really should watch it for yourself. And yes, he did finally feel accepted and actually chose to go to a college that his "family" went to.

His LiveJournal blog turned into a campus website called Facemash, which rates female students on attractiveness. Zuckerberg crashed the Harvard computer network with it and got six months academic probabtion, Kind of creepy. Weren't there others involved in Facebook's early days. The twins, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, who went on to sue Zuckerberg So, did any of the critics have anything bad to say about the movie? Sorkin based his screenplay on a contentious book about the subject, so some of the parts of the story might not be 100 percent accurate Well, it is technically fiction, right? So I wouldn't expect 100 percent truth. The film takes a lot of liberties Seems like I might enjoy The Social Network. Ben Mezrich wrote the original book that Sorkin uses for his screenplay That came out in 2009

yes. I like comedy movies. Do you agree with the rating of the movie? I have not seen the movie. Have you?
I have seen it several times, It was a good movie. It is hard to believe that an 8 year old could come up with such elaborate booby traps. Yes he must of read a lot of books. That movie gave Macaulay Culkin his start in the film industry. I liked the lady that lived in the woods with her birds. Yes she was a good character Oh great on Macaulay Culkin. I felt bad for him when he was sent to the attic for punishment. I don't remember that part.  Yes that is sad I'm glad the bad guys got caught though. Yes it is always good when the bad guys are caught. I believe there has been maybe 3 shows of this movie now, maybe more. Yes I think you are right. The first movie did not get good reviews from movie critics. Do you pay attention to critics reviews of movies? Yes I do pay attention to some of the critics, although I do not always agree with them. l liked the part where the mom has to ride back to chicago in a moving van with the polka band. He did not seem very scared though, at first at being home alone I think every kid imagines having free time at home before they realize all the things they depend on their parents for. Yes that is funny and a different situation in the van.
ver ? well you must come to one of mine soon ! i might but i probably wo not . you can find me at the local library . . . by myself .

Me too. It has a Rotten Tomatoes score of 62%, but I liked it. Yes, it was one of the best family movies back in the 80"s so cute and innocent! They don't make them like that today! Mccalay Kulkin was really good back then-before he went crazy!:-) It was actually made in 1990, can you believe that? I know, seems so recent, time goes by so fast... I liked Joe Pesci in it too
surf and turf . two of my favorite foods , steak and lobster . so good what about dessert ? wedding cake of course . have you never been to a wedding ? ot all weddings are the same . what kind of cake ? 12 layer marble cake with vanilla cream cheese frosting .

I forgot the parents went to Paris. I thought it was New York. New York was the sequel Oh ok! Gus Pollinski is screams John Hughes Yeah I miss John Hughes. He was a great writer and director. didn't know she ran into him at Scranton either. it's weird how after all these years still learning something new Yeah Scranton, soon to be famous because of The Office. John Hughes was the best yeah that's what I was thinking! The best part of this movie were the booby traps for the burglers. I remember they reminded me of the mouse trap game. those were always my favorite parts to watch growing up too again nowadays I think the traps would be so different...probably a lot crueler Yeah and the kid would be charged for hurting the burglers. Good talking to you, have a great day!

Yes I am here. I like the movie. I'm interested in jazz and I appreciate the main character following his passion. Great thank you How did you feel about the acting? Did you enjoy the singing and choreography in the movie? I thought it was decent acting, although the actors were perhaps not that talented singers or dancers. I did enjoy the singing and choreography, and the actors did their best given the fact that they are not professionally trained as singers or dancers. Did you think Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone had good chemistry as co-stars? Yes, they work well together. Do you think this movie was deserving of the accolades and hype it received? Do you agree that the middle of the movie "sags badly"? I think it is mostly deserving of the praise it received. I feel like it was a bit too long for me, and for a romantic comedy... but overall I agree that it was enjoyable to watch It was a great date night movie, and my wife loved it Did you think John Legend did a good job of acting, considering he is more known as a musician? I thought he was okay.. I agree that the 3 of them (Gosling, Stone, Legend) were all stretched John Legend with acting, and the other two with musical performing I do like him though Did you find the characters likable? I did, it was different than most movies I usually watch

almost all have itespecially of wars or super heroes I liked this scene on the top of the Stark Industries building probably because I have a little fear of heights then you suffer a little vertigo
I wasn't too interested in the film. I think the director literally copied the show "Robot Wars" and made a film out of it. In terms of score I'd give it a 4/10. What about yourself? That's a fair point. probably a 5.5/10, I thought some of the robots were pretty neat at least. Yeah the designs of the robots where cool. I won't argue that fact at all. I think the only reason I really watched it was because of Jackman. Some of the robots in the film where actually real which was interesting. I thought it was all CGI. Yeah, Jackman usually does pretty good movies. That's pretty cool, most movies would just do CGI How did you feel about the rest of the characters? I personally don't think I could tell you any of their names to be honest. Same here. It was one of those movies where I just had it on and wasn't devoting my full attention to it. I agree. What did you think of the story? I thought it was cool. The sports world replacing people with machines. I think it could of been better developed though. It definitely was an interesting concept.
wow ! that is a long time . he must have been a hard worker like my pops . my wife just became legally deaf . breaks my heart . sad ! i love the deaf because my dad taught me to love all . how many brothers do you have ? i have six . big fam ! i have 1 brother who started as a cook just like dad how cool ! my full time job is building aquariums . yours ?

hello...! tell me about the movie have you seen it? Home alone is actually a great movie .....loved it I love it also lets discuss about it who is the child actor? i have watched it more than thrice... waoh nice the cast of the movie are kelvin real name  as macaulay culkin joe pesci as harry in the movie the child actor is Macaulay culkin as kevin ..... the movie was produced in 1990 John heard as peter in the movie......! and directed by chris columbus kevin is actually the main character in the movie yes he is and is a nice movie The child artist has acted so well in such a way that he has received a lot of love and awards as well I love the trick he used to catch the theives did the movie receive a award? when this movie got released in theatres he was the centre of attraction among people and artist May be i am not aware of it but the kid might have received awards for the movie yes I guess as much The intelligence was the main thing in the movie where the kid has used and the presence of mind is also important one because he has used it instantly then and there to capture the thieves. what about you...what do you feel? yes he really tried until the police arrived First half of the movie is actually boring a little but the second half of the movie was really great...... such a good movie, and well directed i feel the same way about the first half of the movie there was not  any content in the first part of the movie yes, it was so boring until the game change it is really a good movie, I will love to see it again
wow ! that is cool . yeah , but since i cannot find boots that fit i hate to go skiing . i like to go fishing . no footware required ! do you go ocean fishing ? up there , i meant bass guitar string , not bass fishing , ll yeah , i assumed that is what you meant .
cool . i am watching game of thrones . do you like that show ? i have never watched it before is it good ?
That is an interesting concept. So the kids don't find out? In it, Woody is afraid he is losing the relationship of his owner because he is growing up and his interests are changing Aw, that sounds so sad. Kind of odd though, if you think about it... Self aware toys with an attachment to their owner The kids never know the toys come alive on their own It's an interesting concept Overall, it has a great message about friendship That is very sweet. Toys are probably better than humans about it, ha ha The toys have some great adventures So are there any cliff hangers? It's definitely a great movie that both kids and adults would enjoy no its all resolved I personally don't think you ever outgrow Disney movies Do the toys have elaborate back stories? no, not really No room for spin offs about individual toys, then? But it's a great movie It sounds like it. I will most definitely have to add it to my list I really suggest watching it Do you know when this movie was released? 1995
its so delicious when you grill it . . . my favorite color is green reen is a nice color especially when holding my favorite flower , the rose . roses are nice . i have some in my garden

Ben Affleck played Batman in this one. I think he did a good job, but there was too much backstory for Batman in the movie. It seems like Superman could just kill Batman with ease. Is the movie interesting? Yeah, but they set it up so Batman has kryptonite and thus an advantage. I thought it was interesting as it was an integration of not only the super heros but also their cities of origin. Oh yeah! I forgot about Krypton. Who did the soundtrack? I love movie music. I actually don't remember much about the soundtrack, I think it was mostly background filler music nothing from major music artists like in other movies. Is Batman and Superman Marvel or D.C? I forget. D.C., Wonder Woman was also in the movie! Really! Who plays Wonder Woman? The same person who played her in the Wonder Woman movie, I forget her name though. She was helpful because she got Batman and Superman to get along better towards the end of the movie. Did she use the Lasso of Truth? I don't know if it was of truth but it was glowing and unbreakable That's the one! How long is the movie? 153 minutes! So about 2.5 hours!

Sounds like in this movie, money truely is the root of all evil.  Drugs, divorce, money laundering, FBI investigations. Martin Scorsese directed it, so you know it's got to be good! Wow what else did Martin Scorsese direct? Has it won any awards? Gosh..I'm not sure.  Kyle Chandler's in it, too, so that makes it a winner with me! It sounds like it's a star studded cast. I can't imagine it not being good. Leo's character makes $22 million (illegally) in three hours....whoa! haha I wish I could do that (legally haha) What would you do with $22 million

Yes how about the movie Toy Story it is a great fa ily fil Family film Toy Story sounds like a great movie! What is it about?

Both toys get jealous of the other and go on a journey to reunite with the boy. Is the movie animated? Yes the movie is animated using computer graphics. That seems very interesting! What is the movie rated? I don't know what it is rated. I think that a family movie would be rated GA for general audience Is the movie a comedy? I think so too but I couldn't find that info.

This 3d computer animation was awesome! I think i would have rated it higher Nice! I also thought Steve Carell as Gru, the supervillain was very funny. Is this the first animation you have seen with the collaboration between the directors coffin & renaud? Yes, it is the only movie I have seen by these directors. I wonder how the French animation studio may have influenced the overall aesthetic or direction of the film. The Gru was one of my favorite characters too however I think Dr. Nefario's character was better I also liked Dr. Nefario's character. Russell Brand did a great job. I think that since this movie is short it makes it easier for kids to like it. I agree! I think that where the film lacks in CGI, it makes up for in its amusement, quick laughs, and funny punch lines I think how they animated the super villains in despicable me made them lovable and helped them steal the show Definitely! It was also funny how Gru stole the Great Pyramid of Giza. It is not realistic but very laughable. I cant believe this debuted almost 8 years ago already it seems like it was only recently the minions in this 3d animation remind me of oompa loompas lol Certainly! What did you think adults would think of the movie versus kids? The movie hit a high point when Gru stole the shrink ray. I think adults were able to get the under lying jokes that kids did not but that they liked it because of the minions and the small play time of the movie. I agree! have you seen any other of pixars CGI cartoons? I am not sure. But I did like the CGI during the scene where Gru sells parts of his lair to construct the spacecraft.
oh that is pretty cool . i managed to get a job at a museum . oh lucky museums have the best chocolate
o , i buy everything i need . i have really long curls you my hair is long and straight , down to my knees .
humour can send you a lot of messages and perhaps through laughter you can send some powerful messages across the world i agree Yes, I agree. It also shows us how unanswered prayers or getting a "no" to our prayers is sometimes for the best even though we don't realize it. Albeit, in a comedic way. This is probably one of my fave roles jim carrey has played Sometimes we don't see the whole picture of our life because we do not have the knowledge about the future and we start complaining about the things that why our prayers not getting answered but there is a wisdom behind it and just like the picture shows that every prayer cannot have yes otherwise the problems will be there which was fact for me in this movie
I am not sure how accurate it is. Who directed it? Baz Luhrmann was the director. Who wrote the soundtrack? I don't know who wrote the soundtrack. Do you know how much it made in the box office? I do not know how much it made but it was filmed on a $190 million budget. DId it win any awards? I don't know if won any awards or not. Is it out on DVD?
ow are you doing today i am great dog . how bout yourself ? what do you like to do ? i am doing alright getting ready ing ready for what ? i am interested i am going to ask my girlfriend o marry you ? that is amazing . i have 3 children , its an exciting time ! yes it is very exciting

True. Another one of my favorite aspects is that it's two females who are the leaders in the film, giving little girls something to look up to yes and its amazing that a men directed it , also other movies like the little mermaid was given created by a man which its nice that you might think a women can come up with this ideas but also men When I think about the complexity of the plot as the two sisters get older, it's amazing to me that even children can follow along and enjoy this
like tupac said , california knows how to party .

Not very good rotten tomato scores and metacritics scores tho :( Only one good score from CinemaScore A+ Yeah, I wonder why such the big gap with them and the others I grew up in Baltimore- did not realize it was about a baltimore bzsed team either Yes, makes me wonder too. It seems the film is based on a book of the same name Yeah, i was just reading that. I had no idea lol True story too I may need to watch this movie- has some good actors, seems to be a good storyline and things im a little bit familiar with It seems Sandra Bullock got most of the praise and not the actor who plays the football player from the critical response Yeah, that is a bit wrong to me since HE was the main character and a story about him.
yes i can i made on of david copperfield once hat is cool ! do you like magic ? yes , and his book is awesome
you mean mainstream music ? i am confused .
He was very good in that version. I don't think I would even watch this on TV. From what I just read it sounds like they don't trust each other at all and are somewhat at odds. This plot sounds really bad.  I don't like the idea of two super heroes existing in the same movie like this. The backgrounds don't seem to flow too well.
do you have any hobbies ? i love to gamble yeah
i have posters on my wall posters are cool . i dream of traveling outside the us , once my fear is beat . i also love magic shows
hey are a lot of work , but so worth it ! i love kids . children are a bundle of joy .
is it hot there ? i imagine it is much hotter than ny . it is very hot . thankfully i can just put on shorts or a skirt
Based on a short story? that sounds interesting like it would be a quick ride Yeah, it stars Hugh Jackman, who I always enjoy and Evangeline Lilly I love Rocky,  and Wolverine haha. Sounds like a winner I assume its like 100 years in the future type thing?
It was directed by Pierre Coffin How did it score in the reviews? It is an animation movie staring by Steve Carrel as Gru I do enjoy animation movies, especially those that are funny, what goes on it the movie? Jason Seggel as Victor and Russel Brand as Dr Nefario It has a Rating by Rotten Tomatoes of 81% an average of 6.8 /100 Those are great ratings. OHH REALLY YOU ENJOY ANIMATION MOVIES , ME NOT QUIT BUT IT IS OK.. yeah.. I did not watched the movie also thats why I'm just reading the description  ahaha So sorry for the delay of the anwers though Oh I see, well I mean it sounds interesting to me, no problem. I wonder if it's a drama or a comedy Its a litle of an action because in the story sombody was stolen something from the character and to his minions.. ahaha.. now I know this movie was also characters by the minions the minions was good so i could totally see myself checking this one out. I think this is the movie that Minions where well known Makes sense to me, when did it come out? Yeah I think I going to watched this movie also ohh wait I'll just read when It was released july 9 of 2010 IT was a dubut film of Illumination Entertainment
oh no . that is not good . my cat helps a lot with my anxiety . i like cats . . . but love men more . oh i wish i had a boyfriend . my brother and dad are so over protective though . i would love to have so many men in my life . i must have daddy issues . haha . oh goodness . i hope i can move out soon from my dads house . well maybe you can get a job in publishing like me !

Okay.  Have you seen the movie Zootopia?
That was definitely interesting What did you think about the wormhole? I thought it was a really cool plot device and it was awesome seeing Loki visit Earth I didn't know that this movie had a 92% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, that's pretty cool What did you think about Loki Enslaving the agents That was really neat and added a lot of tension to the movie I liked that one of the engines failing caused the Hulk to transform What did you think about Thor trying to stop him? What about when thor was thrown from the ship I liked when Loki tricked them. Definitely dramatic I thought it was sad when Loki killed Coulson Yeah, very sad, but it really brought them together and was a strong motivating force I thought it was really cool that New York City was the wormhole's location I think New York is were most movie battles are. Haha true I love the scene where Hulk finds Loki and beats him up Yes to me that is the best part of the movie. He is funnier in hulk mode Definitely, I loved the comedic relief What were your thoughts on stark going through the wormhole Very suspenseful, but I love how Hulk saved him He looked like he was the hulks toy haha Did you think it ended well? Yes but I do not think that they should have let thor take Loki. Yeah, it was too neatly wrapped up in a bow at the end, there should have been some cliffhangers or something Yes like Loki escaping. But they did let everyone know that there would be more movies. Yeah, I'm glad that we got some more movies out of it haha For sure  I think that did a great job at picking the cast for the characters as well Absolutely, lots of star power Well, thanks for chatting!
i am a computer technician . its very boring does it pay well ? i worry about money and want a good career . o not really . only thing that makes me happy is coming home to my dog at night hat is awesome . i want a dog but my dad is too strict about it . yeah . they are a lot of responsibility was it hard becoming a computer technician ? i have not been great with school . o not really i was always good with computers my best friend is also good with them , he could probably teach me a bit . probably so . its not hard to learn . oh my tea is ready !

Poor shark has a bounty on his head. All he wants to do is eat vacationers. I mean, it's his job, right? I say watch it and root for the shark. None of the people are very sympathetic, anyway, and he has to defend his fin from the Diner's Club set. You know I can recall alway being on the sharks side. The crew was kinda more corrupted if you think about it I totally agree. How about the amateur shark-hunting frenzy that the second death sets off? Whose water is it, anyway????? Defending its home is what I say. You’re right and who just swims in the middle of the night (that lady) in the ocean not expecting something bad to happen? She was in shark territory

I have. How did you like it? I really enjoyed it. I'm a big fan of Spielberg and DiCaprio. Yes DiCaprio is awesome. Do you remember the name of the actor he played? Yeah it was Frank Abagnale, Jr. The entire cast was great. Yes. Tom Hanks and Christopher Walked. What year did the movie come out? It came out in 2002 and received rave reviews. Do you remember the scene where Frank pretended to be a substitute teacher? Yes, I've read some of the reviews and they are stellar. Yes, Great scene. Agreed. Frank went through a lot in his childhood and that made his character more empathetic He did. I love the scene where he tries to cash a check by flirting with the teller. So funny Lol yeah, Leo's charisma really shines through in the movie There were lots of sad scenes too There was. I can't believe he never attended flight school. To funny. Do you remember if it was nominated for any Oscar's? I'm not sure. It may have been considering the strength of the cast and the director. One oscar-worthy scene was Frank realizing that his dad passed away. Leo should have won an oscar just for that scene I remember it being nominated for 2. Not sure if it was for that scene. Lol Lol, maybe the scene pushed it over the edge. What I like about the movie is that its a story of redemption, especially the ending Yes, so true. It was so well written.
what a good life ! the beach , and a convertible . i just putter around my garden . it sure is ! do you have a car ? i have an old truck . in kentucky , we have lakes , but no ocean . cool ! i love any large body of water yes , me too . growing up in kentucky , i knew i wanted to retire near water . have you ever been to the ocean ?
which is better wwII movie dunkirk or shindlers list? i've actually never seen schiendler's list. it really warmed my heart when they made the guy george a hero in the newspaper. i also liked the ending on the train.
I think it was one of those films that doesn't make huge waves but it is a decent film. I've definitely seen worse movies. Yeah I have as well. It is one of those comedies that serves its purpose.
hat is still a great skill to have . yeah , there is gonna be a wedding scene too . cool . make it super magical .

What did you think when he admitted being Iron man publicly? I thought it was smart, he will be able to increase his wealth which allows him to spend more money on new technology Did you enjoy the fight between Stark and Stane? oh yeah, on top of the Stark building? That was pretty cook cool nice talking with you!
He was pretty good in that role. I also did not know Tim Allen played Buzz Lightyear. It is funny  the things you notice as an adult. I saw it when I was already an adult. I took my nephew to see it when he was 5 years old. That is awesome! The movie reviews and critical responses were all mostly very positive so I am sure it was enjoyable for both you and your nephew. Rotten Tomatoes scored it a 100%! Yes! I know we enjoyed it in different ways. For me, seeing some of the toys I played with as a child - Slinky Dog, and Mr. Potato Head - made it more enjoyable. Would you classify the film as a comedy? Comedy-Adventure? I think that some of the jokes were clearly aimed at adults. I would have to agree. Many of the green army guys' jokes were aimed towards the adult audience. I found it interesting that Buzz thought he was real while the rest of the toys knew they were not. I was thinking about Mr. Potato Head's reaction to Barbie! He kept saying, "I'm a married spud!" I also had a Mr. Potato head growing up so it was funny to watch him interact with the other toys. I think his movie personality was accurate. I thought it was clever how all the toys spied on Andy's party with the baby monitors. Do you remember the Pizza Planet scenes? Yes, when Andy took Woody with him instead of Buzz. I thought it was hysterical when Buzz got trapped in the toy crane game with all the little green aliens. Yes! I really liked the animation and the way the scenes were from different perspectives. I believe this is the time when SId comes into the movie. I remember I had a neighbor who looked just like him lol. I think all of us knew a rotten kid like Sid! It is a little disturbing, though...Sid knows that the toys are alive, but tortures them anyway. I remember when Andy got a puppy for Christmas and all the toys were freaking out!
And the Jimmy Hoffa bit was good too Omg can you even imagine ?? In this day and age? Total anarchy The way they broke up these paragraphs makes it seem like he reconciled with grace way earlier than he did at least if I remember correctly it's like your typical "I learned the error of my ways, I really have changed" and then the movie ends with everything being okay Yeah I agree I just laughed out loud remembering him messing with Steve Carrell's character even on air poll omg *lol classic stuff didn't he plant weed in the van too? so good Haha! I don't remember that part. Hilarious I need to watch it again soon
i love music ! i love blaring katy perry in the car and travelling ! wow , i wo not lie that sounds absolutely terrible . ! the katy perry part or the driving part ? ! he katy perry part for sure . who your favorite artist ? i am deaf , all i do is watch shows on netflix with captions on do you know sign language ? i am still learning , but i love to practice ! yes i do , my sister helped me learn it , she is my best friend y sisters are crazy ! how many sisters or brothers do you have ?
i am good . what is up ? just listening to my favorite story read by my favorite reader , the price of love wesome . i am watching vampire diaries . i like walking cemeteries and thinking about the people who used to live i am going to be in barbados next month on vacation . i will probably have a couple picnics in the park and cry over my boyfriend i am excited . why do you walk cemeteries ? i live near one inside a park . its very old and the tombstones are interesting i think that is pretty chill honestly i do not understand the phrase pretty chill is that good or bad it is a really positive phrase riders of the purple sage is an interesting title can you guess what it is about cowboys maybe ? i am not sure . lol i do not really know either it was my dads favorite book
funny , my son said i was talking about cake in my sleep last night oh my . that sounds like me ! i am not the greatest at baking though oh . that is ok . i sew alot you ?
ostly my dad . he s a retired cop and he has ptsd as well . sounds like anxiety runs in your family . are you seeing anyone for it ? i got ptsd from being held at gunpoint by a crazy man at work
wow ! how horrible . just stay positive during your wedding . old woman advice . it will be a struggle but i have to do what i have to do . you will get through it . eat some chocolate cake . helps my grandson when he is sad . i can not let it ruin such a precious day . o you can not . i remember my wedding day like it was yesterday .
why do you find it hard to relax ? i was held up in a store what do you mean by held up ?
yes, that's correct Never heard of anyone in the cast except Justin, how about you I think I know andrew garfield anyways, I kind of like biographic movies how about you Me too, it has pretty good reviews and based of Mark Zuckerberg Didn't know it was based off an actual book and the book was, i guess, based on actual people lol yep, lol Pretty good ratings as you said, it did get good revies yep, 96% rotten tomatoes average 90s btw, it said, they took liberties with the subjects kind of biographical/fictional i guess Yeah, so it wasn't actually true kind of hate that they probably made up some things to keep up suspense that's right they need to make money too
I agree, especially since Mark Zuckerberg was not consulted for the film and his character is often portrayed as callous and manipulative. However, if he was involved in it he would probably want his character to be more positive, even if that wasn't accurate to the real story. So true! It's funny how they basically defined the dark irony of the last decade! Director David Fincher did an awesome job making this a movie of the year though! I'd like to see it again, it's been several years and I liked it a lot the first time I saw it. Do you know much about the Mezrich book The Accidental Billionaires? True! It is hard to belive it was released in 2010! I honestly don't other than what Aaron Sorkin based the screenplay on!  Hard to believe this all basically started over Zuckerberg being dumped by his girlfriend! Same for me. I am curious about the actual events with Mark and his girlfriend. He treats her very poorly in the movie So true! Especially how he wrote an insulting entry about her on his LiveJournal blog!
cool i like to swim . i like talking to random strangers . love it
o open my own restaurant .
I would say so. Doesn't always mean I agree with the ratings. In the first key scene, I would be drawn into the story. I like knowing her backstory that she was found in the river with wounds on her neck and now has to communicate through sign language. I liked Sally Hawkins performance being mute Why did you enjoy her performance? I enjoyed her performance as mentally handicapped Benicio del Toro is a great director I dont think she was mentally handicapped. She just wasn't able to speak - assuming it was because of when she was little and had whatever freak accident. This movie is multifaceted with lots of different dimensions. She has sex with a river creature in her bathroom He also eats one of her cats. That would be a deal breaker for me. I don't think that scene in the movie added to anything and probably could have gone without it. It shows how the creature can heal when he slashes Gile's arm Elisa had to go and find him and bring him back to the apartment.

Are you still there?
It is a children's movie, so it is only rated G and there is not explicated content. Some funny scenes where parents will understand more than the child. Good to know. As a matter of fact, I think I remember the original one back in 2001, and it was really good. This must be a prequel film, am I correct? Since it takes place in the college years as opposed to them working regular jobs. BI'm really getting interested The original was a classic. Yes you are right, this would be the prequel to the first one where you really get to know the characters. I loved watching this one, and then going back and watching the first and seeing how they transitioned from college to the work field. What is the typical genre of movies you watch?

Ya.  I was aware of Wonder Woman before the film, but learned a lot about her backstory after watching the movie. I was unaware of her relation to Zeus. And that she currently lives in Paris - seems this movie happens in flashback to her past That was much needed.  It says Wonder Woman made her debut in 2016 Batman v. Superman but only had a small role. Looking at the story plot and the complex relationships that they want you to keep track of it seems like they are setting up for sequel that they want you to come back for. I'm sure.  DC needs to make more movies like Wonder Woman to gain more popularity. I'll bet Diana and Steve fall for each other there - seems almost deliberate that they didn't have that this time.
sorry about about i no you no that a miss you should probably turn off caps lock and use proper english . . . i have five children what about you i have 3 children and 8 grandchildren . what do you like to do in your free time ? shopping , like to go fishing also i like to garden outside of my house , i have a small garden . hat sound good i like truck farming hat is too technical for me do you work and where do you work

why don't you like her? I don't know Seen her in too many movies, I guess did I mention it also delves into drug addiction? It's from 2009
YEAH, SJ IS SO ADORABLE! MIKE WAS SUCH A SWEETHEART. THEY PICKED GREAT ACTORS FOR THAT MOVIE. No doubt, I have often thought of reading the book Mike wrote called The Blind Side Evolution of a game, just cause I loved the movie so much oh, wow, i didn't even know there was a book out! that's incredible. i love to read! i wonder if the blind side was based on a book first? I would like to read it but I just don't get sports. Quinton Abton was Big Mike though, he played that part so well.
Really? Is it a comedy? Yes but also an adventure. It is an animated Disney movie that folllws a snow quesn I love Disney movies. Especially those that have queens. She has to find her lost sister who has accidentally used her powers to trap their kingdom in a permanent winter. It’s quite the story It sounds incredible. I would definitely go see it.
hey there ! i would not know what to do without my cell
I think it's good to have some movies with a good message sometimes
I wasn't really a big fan of it. What about you? Me either.  I think the critics got it right. Yes for sure I like batman, but I don't like how they portrayed him in this movie. And I don't really remember the superman movie. I don't like the premise of the movie from the start.   Why would anyone want to see 2 hero's fight? The two together though just wasn't a good match. Right on For real. You got that right! I just didn't see the point I couldn't get into it at all. I couldn't even finish the movie Not to mention that Ben Affleck was Bruce Wayne. What a hack. Ha yeah! What were they thinking. And Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. What is this the Disney channel. Hahaha nice! Lex Luthor should be someone that at least look intelligent and ominous. When Rotten Tomato gave it a 4.9/10 it was a gift. Waste of money! That's what I was thinking. That was too high of a rating! Henry Cavill as superman is hot...in a kind of Broke Back Mountain sort of way. HA! Did you read this Critical Response?  "As the film progresses, Lex degenerates into a gibbering mad man, some strange mix ofthe Riddler and the Joker with a little bit of Mark Zuckerberg added for flair." I can't believe they made it over two hours long at that! Thank god we only have to endure this for 15 min
o i do not have any kids yet . 3 sisters though . i am in nursing school i wish i could be a nurse . i do not enjoy blood though yea some people do not handle it well . you live in a house or apartment ? i live in an apartments . currently i am looking for a job yea i am in a studio apartment . tiny but it works

oh shoot wrong movie my bad hang on haha I was thinking Wolf of Wall Street love Angelina Jolie i was wondering about where there were drugs in this movie lol maybe I was on them yah angelina jolie is good I remember this I don't think I hated it thats good Did you ever see the Jolie movie where where she's a superspy with brad pitt? and people can shoot bullets and make them curve? no, but that was a good one sounds like the matrix? no check her wikipedia videography worth a watch i dunno loved Mr and MRs. Smith thogh maleficient just seems like a strange concept but oh well why not yeah, like a jumble of ideas
awesome then i might watch it did you see it when it was released? Sounds good. I think you would enjoy it very much. I know I did. I really like Sandra Bullock Movies I did see it when it was released. Yeah, I loved her acting in Miss Congeniality Yes, one of my favorites. A lot of her older ones as well. Do you have any other questions about the Movie ? How long is the movie? It was pretty long, maybe a little over 2 hours. wow, thats a long movie It's one of those movies that you can rewatch over and over and not get tired of it. It feels like Watching it for the first time, every time. oh so you have seen it more than once?

Great, you? Trying to avoid the snowstorm here! Same! Watching any good movies? Not right now, but saw The Post and thought it was very good.

Hello..  My kids and I favorite is Frozen. But we are all for Disney movies!  How about you? Whats Frozen about ? My favorite is probably the Matrix Frozen is an animated children's movie, but adults love it too! Matrix is good too!  I can't remember, is it kid friendly? Who are the actors in Frozen? Kristen Bell plays Anna and Idina Menzel is Elsa.  Jonathan Groff is Kristoff. . We have watched it probably hundred times or more since it came out in 2013.  My girls love it. I would love to take them to see it on ice!  The production is wonderful. hahah. Oh thats so cool they have an on ice production. Where is that at? Does that mean theres singing in the movie? Typically if they are doing an ice production, they might make it at a big center (like the Sprint Center) or something like that.  And yes, LOTS of singing in it.  Just in an animated version. So is it like a musical? Again, my kids love all Disney movies though.  So The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast are classics too.  It has lots of singing in it.  But it isn't just pure singing! There is a plot and good characters! I like most of the Disney movies also. Have they seen Moana ? whats the plot about? Oooh, Moana is another favorite! The girl (Elsa) has magical powers that can turn anything into ice.  It shows her having to raise her sister (Anna) after her parents were killed, but she couldn't keep her powers under control and eventually even turned her sister into ice.  Sad and cute all at the same time. That sounds pretty interesting! i see why your kids like it Moana is pretty good I like the soundtrack for it a lot plus its always fun to sing along Yes, they love it!  Probably a bit more obsessed than love at times! How old are they? Yes, so fun to sing along too.  We pull the songs off of Alexa and we sing to lots of Disney movies everyday. My younger ones are 7 and 4.  But my older 2 kids love those movies too! hahaha, yeah i have the soundtrack on spotify downloaded! have you see the greatest showman? its more recent and not Disney

Yes he was in the military and they met in a party. He knew that she was in a higher class status than him, and wanted to have money inorder to gain status. it seems with these extravagant parties, he achieved that wealth? Yes, but by bootlegging. So he wasn't looked to high upon. At least the ones with old money. how did daisy perceive the wealth? She liked it, she had a great time with him for awhile, then at some point Gatsby confronts her to tell her "Husband" that she never loved him, which was not true. Then she runs away, and Gatsy follows her, there is this very strange driving scene. You find out that someone in that car, hit a women and Gatsby gets the blame. The husband of that woman goes to Gatsby to confront him. very interesting, it sounds like quite an interesting movie. I may have to watch it, as it's catching my interest thanks! Takecare.

I can appreciate jazz, but it's not one of my favorite genres. Do you? not my favorite either I prefer more forethought and craftsmanship in my music improv doesn't suit me I agree with that. I do appreciate that a contemporary movie is bringing jazz into it. Jazz isn't usually found in mainstream movies gotta go. peace.

Would you change the name to the movie? Iron man is too iconic, though i'm quite sure he changes the element it's made of Totally agree "Electromagnetically powered suit ma" doesnt quite roll of the tongue Do you have a favourite scene? I personally love his initial "donning" when he flies to afganistan to jsut kick ass for like 8 minutes Sort of cements his identity as a hero
I'm not a huge fan of the Wonder Woman movie itself, but they did a good job with her in the Justice League movie. I'm iffy as well on the whole backstory and the way they did her in her own movie. I am glad they do become friends She is very different. I did like the Justice League, but haven't seen the Wonder Woman movie, yet. She is different. Almost so different they should have made up a whole new character for her. Justice League is much better of the two. It can be a bit confusing watching without having seen Batman V Superman, since it shows how he was dead. Very true. They tried to create an entire new image for her but keep the same name. Is it Super Girl that was a TV show for a while? Yes, on the CW. They mixed it with Arrow and the Flash for a lot of crossovers I don't know how well that did but I do enjoy these movies with a variety of different super powered people, like, "Gifted." There is quite a few now. Yeah, without being too over the top. Marvel does a good job with them as well. Like Daredevil on Netflix is pretty good.
haha yeah me too, this last chat reminded me of buzz, remember him? I do personally i like having my strings pulled do you know what 'cinimascore is? maybe how well it does at the box office? I think it's what the cinema owners rating is. Not entirely sure though Could be that too

I did enjoy this moive! It got a decent score on rotten tomatoes. Had you seen it before? So did I! I think that the idea of a child somehow being left behind during a family vacation is great. I had seen it once before. Had you?

Do you remeber when he started hearing prayers in his head? He tried to say yes  to all of them. Yes I do remember I also liked when he had discussions with Morgan Freeman and was walking on water. . . Morgan Freeman makes the movie also He also played wonderfully with Steve Carrell. Steve is the anchorman that accepted the job that Bruce wanted on air. Yes, he did. Steve Carrel is super funny. He used his God powers to make a fool of Steve on the news. Yes, when he stole dialogue Yes.  Bruce also started to win the job by being on interviews when the body of Jimmy Hoffa was found. . Also, a meteor just happens land near a cookoff competition that he is covering. . . I don't recall that part.
That's great news!  Do you watch it every Christmas? It was released quite a long time ago! I try to. It played in theaters this most recent Christmas Yeah, 1990 Oh, really?  I don't think it did in my city! That's awesome! Harkins played it. It is very awesome I really like Joe Pesci! Great actor! The ratings were not good I noticed that!  I wonder why??? It got a 62 percent on rotten tomatoes. It's odd At least the CinemaScore was high Especially because you said it was a great movie! It's a classic, yet sometimes it takes awhile for a great movie like that to be realized I was just reading through the key scenes!  Are they real good ones?? Very true statement!

YES it is a one of a comedy movie It was definitely funny, especially the parts with the snowman. 3D movie vey nice Anna sets out on a journey with an iceman And it was inspired by "The Snow Queen" by Hans Christian Andersen. Yes, Anna wants to find her estranged sister. Yes IMDB rating 7.5/10 And an 89% fresh rating from Rotten Tomatoes. Yes defenetely I enjoyed the parts with the trolls. It is a box office movie The part where the parents die was sad. Love is an open door song very nice Yes it is. I loved Elsa's ice palace. I am also love so much I'm surprised different voice actors voiced the sisters at different ages. I thought Kristen Bell and Idina Menzel voiced them all the way through. Frozen" is the world's 10th-highest-grossing film of all time. That doesn't surprise me. It was very popular. Yes it a true word The part where Elsa accidentally freezes Anna's heart is also sad. Yes i think so Did you think that Marshmallow was scary? Yes i know And Hans turned out to be a villain. Yes i think so He left Anna to die. Yes it is a really sad situation Yes.

It seemed pretty inspirational, most movies that portray the struggle into success is worth watching. Yes, it looks like Michael Oher experience a lot of hardship growing up. experienced* Yeah, seems like he beat the odds drastically. It just goes to show you that hard work and a little bit of luck can get you far in life. I agree. He definitely made it from the bottom. Yeah you got that right I had no idea Sandra Bullock was in this to be honest And Tim McGraw Those are some big names. Haha I was about to say that It has some great reviews too. I can't believe he ran away at a young age. Can't blame him though, it's hard to go through normal life when a family member is on drugs all the time Seems he had some good luck with some good people that helped him get into school and football.

Thank you, i think i will too, i have never been disappointed by those actors No, i think that would be all Glad to be of assistance. Please let me know how you liked it! That way I can make better recommendations for you in the future. Thanks for all the info, it was nice talking to you Likewise. Always a pleasure. Enjoy your movie! Don't forget to pop some popcorn. I also recommend an ice cold Coca-Cola. You need to keep refreshed what with all the laughing in your near future. Haha, that alone, actually, made me laugh. Could you remind me what year was the movie released? The year 2003.
haha not too bad, I loved this movie so it's fun seeing what they want me to talk about Thats good you've seen it and don't have to just go from the description I was worried I would have to do that What movie is it? Yeah me too. Zootopia It got an insanely good Rotten Tomatoes rating which I feel like is pretty hard to get Wow yes such a good movie Are they stingy with their stars I don't usually look at ratings What does have ratings for it about?
Baz Luhrmann directed it but its not my cup of tea. Its the first time i remember seeing Joel Edgerton in a movie, he's terrific. I think the performances are 'fine' and I like that it's a period piece from 1920s. The costumes are wonderful. i heard the movie was filmed in Australia right? if i am not wrong this movie was released in 2013, 5 years ago Kind of a weird adaptation. I didn't know ti was filmed in Austrailia. Kind of odd since its such an American Story. I bet it had a huge budget. Do you know what the budget was? yeah i think the movie was made with a $190 million budget, a looooot of money!! good night! Who played Daisy? I don't remember. i thing Daisy was played by Carey Mulligan I don't think the movie was very well received, if I recall correctly. oh really i do not remember... Like I don't think critics liked it much. How did it do on Rotten Tomatoes? well i did not like it so much.. if it counts jajajaja ... i think it got 48% so low That seems low! You would think that movies about rich people would invite people to go see it just for the escapist aspect. They kind of have rich people problems about parties and such.
what do you do for work ? is it something library related ? i am an engineer during the day cool , dude . i do not know if i could do that .
i also like art ! i create a lot of it so i guess i could say my favorite subject is class painting s i am getting old , i prefer cross stitching what do you look like , i have blue eyes and blonde hair i have white hair , i also have a pizza sushi in my mouth ! my favorite how old are you ? i am 45 i like to say i am at the golden age ! i really like sushi and tacos are really tasty sushi ! i love it ! pizza too , as i said
i spend a lot of times in the wild . seem like it what a wonderful night it is yes it is very quiet here . people are so weird looking oh come on it is not halloween yet . he night air is so awesome yes it makes me want to sleep .
oh no ! i will just give them a tuna cake .
yeah it is my favorite place what do you do for a living ? i currently learn in college
It really, Bullock is the only big name in it, but like I said her performance is very good. I LIKE SANDRA  BULLOCK SHE IS VERY GOOD. I agree.  She is good at bringing the family together to support someone that is having a tough go in life and its really what everyone wants in a family YOU SAID IT ALL.
do u think it is entertaining? yes I do these girls were daughters of king/queen? yes they were both princesses (well until Elsa was crowned Queen) why Elsa was crowned and not Anna because of magical powers? I believe it had to do with age, Elsa was the oldest child
Haven't heard of that one.  How good is it, would you suggest I check it out? Apparently it has Jim Carrey in it. Which, if you love comedy, yes! sounds like something similar to Batman, is it I absolutely adore comedy I'm not sure if it is similar to Batman. what's the main theme, or plot of the movie, Bruce Wayne, of course, is how I came that conclusion?  Though Carrey is one of my favs So Jim Carrey plays as the main character, named Bruce. And is working for a tv station but wants to be the main news anchorman. He goes on this journey in search of his goal, while engaging with... guess MORGAN FREEMAN!!!!!! He plays as the God character. Also Bruce (Carrey) has a girlfriend named Grace played by Jennifer Aniston. Freeman, as a God character, way funny!!! Right?? The movie was made in 2003. Love Jenn Aniston, anything she is in, has to be a hit So a bit of an old movie.
Hey, whats up. Are you in the mood for some comedy movie? Sure any movie you have in mind? Bruce Almighty, one of my top 5 favorite if not top 3 favorite comedy movies of all time. Hahahaha Same here! I love that movie, Im a huge fan of Jim Carrey. Damn. Can we be best friends? :D Hahaha, this is definitely a movie ? I would to watch again and again.
yea . and i listen to pink while i draw he color or the artist ? because she is a god !
Hi there Have you ever seen the Movie toy story? I have not! Is it worth watching? Its a great movie Its an animated movie that is based on a childs toys coming alive so the idea is when a child leaves their room , the toys come to life and play games and have fun That sounds very interesting...  do you know who voices some of the characters? yes- actually some surprisingly famous actors Tom Hanks is the main character- Woody- A cowboy doll Is that so?! Who are they? Oh hes one of my favorites! I love Tom! Do you know who else? Tim Allen Plays his buddy and sidekick Buzz Lightyear Tim is a great actor! and they even have Don Rickles as Mr Potato Head That is awesome! Sounds like an all star cast of voices! So do you know how the film was rated by the ? Like rotten tomatoes and Cinemascore? Rotten Tomatoes gave it 100% Cinemascore gave it an A That is amazing and extremely rare! Wow!!! it is rare esp[ecially for an animated movie I think what makes it so good with all is that everyone grew up playing with toys and at one time thought their toys were larger than life Indeed! Critics are usually harsh on animated films. Toy Story must be amazing! Do you know who directed the movie? Yeah it sounds like it has a nostalgia factor to it that will make adults love it as well! The director was John Lasseter- and it was his directorial debut the movie came out in 1995 and I think it holds even till now Sounds like he did an amazing job then if this was his debut and he received 100 on Rotten Tomatoes! yes, I wish I knew other films he did after but Im sure they do no top Toy Story That is true! Do you know who wrote the movie?
ot yet , but someday i will be . just have to find the right person first yeah just get stuff sorted out first hat is my plan . finish school , find a better job , and maybe move too .
I agree! I think that its a weird love story that would actually make me feel a little connected Same, haha. I'm not usually into that kinda stuff, but I think the outside influences around all of it kinda get me more interested than a typical love story would I think that both of the people are handicapped in a way and thats probably why it works really well because they can understand how each other is feeling Oh yeah definitely Its kind of like a drama too so you don't have to be so into the love story haha That's an interesting point. I hadn't really thought about the whole handicapped in a way thing The government intrigue is what really hooked me, I think
llo ! how are you today any plans ? hey ! not really , i am craving some pizza ! hat sounds yummy . i work as an accountant you ? i am unemployed right now . maybe applying at a pizza joint !

Ok, you are keeping me intrigued... Did it win any awards? I'm not sure off of the top of my head, you'd have to look it  up, but it definitely deserved one in my eyes! The Oscars don't always get it right in my opinion. If it were up to you, what award(s) would you give it? Hmmm Probably best visual effects! It was REALLY beautiful!
llo bro what are you up to ?
Well since it's so new they may have not made one yet. But since it had such great reviews I'm sure they will! I I'll tell you if I enjoyed watching it but I'm sure I will!

I don't know much of her work but I am a big fan of Guillermo Del Toro and it seems the critics had alot to say on this film as well ! I'll have to check out his other films. I am impressed that a movie about a humanoid amphibian creature could be described as "elegant and mesmerizing". that is quite the compliment indeed, I have yet to see the it but i definitely plan too.are you a fan of drama films?
it was historically accurate they used boats that participated in the evacuation and period airplanes These movies are usually good when it comes to art direction yes it does not have much dialogue to create suspension they used thousands of extras I'm sure
No, but I heard he's going to play Mr. Rogers in a new biopic. So glad he'll be back on the big screen soon! HE IS VERY FUNNY OH FUN HE DOES KIND OF REMIND ME OF MR RODGERS So funny. I love him. THATS GOOD HE IS DOING MORE STUFF AGAIN IS THE MOVIE A REALLY LONG MOVIE Yeah, anyway, getting back to Toy Story, his voice acting skills bring a lot of emotion to the story. No, it's an average length movie. HE HAS A GOOD VOICE FOR CHARACTER ANIMATION OH GOOD I DONT LIKE TO WATCH TV FOR TOO LONG I LIKE BEING OUTSIDE MORE

I think they could have done better than Ben Affect for Batman though... even though I do like Affect I think so too! But supposedly he is retiring from the role before the next movie, so we will see how that goes I think the Rotten Tomatoes score should have been better than 27% though... Oh wow Yeah, 27% is really low. I'd give it probably like a 65% but I don't mind mindless action I also think it's really stupid how both of their mothers were named 'Martha' I couldn't believe that Luther demanded Superman Kill Bat!man Me too
i love blues and jazz . what do you mean by that ?
yes and only sulley made it in the roar sorority they got into a fight because of it and broke the cherished scream can
Ya it felt like he was singled out a little too much. If I saw one of my brothers treating my son like that, the way the uncle speaks to him, I would be so angry! Exactly As a kid though I think we respond to intense versions of what we're experiencing, so if they only "lightly" bullied him we might not have recognized it.

Yea I know.  The FBI was on to him like blood hounds. And I wasn't surprised at all when he spilled the beans on his colleagues. Boy.. He was in full psycho mode here, huh? Yea for sure, the scene where he crashes is ridiculous. The arrest probably saved his life in all seriousness the rate he was going Definitely. He was going full speed down a dark path. Such an incredible story. I knew Donnie was a rat the whole time Yea for sure.

hello How are you I am good how are you? Thank you i am fine Have you seen the movie Its a great movie Yes I have seen it, and I found it quite good. It wasn't your typical Disney live-action, but it is due to this that it was great. definitely surpassed the ideas seen in Frozen. Lol The movie Maleficent is also a great look at the untold story of Sleeping Beauty Yes its true Well sleeping beauty its an old movie bud really good I think the new ones are excellent as well So very true. I just like the digital look of the fairytale setting that plays off the original animated scenery. Are you a fan lf disney movies? This movie did cause me to loathe King stefan though... I mean he tore her wings off. I like pirates of the Caribbean more than all the other Disney' Yes and No. I find that the animated films are quite nostalgic, but the live-action films like Maleficent in which you see the darkness behind the films cater better to me nowawdays. True i think you are a good movie reader Though I do find the Jerry Burckheimer productions better than Robert Stromberg who did Maleficent Yes you are correct But Maleficent has a far more heartbreaking background than the Pirates movies.the background of Maleficent, and even the fact taht she cared for Aurora despite her villian status makes her likeable and hateable at the same time Which ones are your favorite movies animated or action How many times have you seen this movie I quite have not seen the whole movie
Batman vs Superman Nice how did you enjoy it? I guess it was...okay? Yea I heard the reviews for it were up and down It was better than Man of Steel, but nothing compared to the Christopher Nolan Batman movies. Did you see it at home or in the Theaters? Right Idk I feel like all the DC live action movies are meh Yeah, me too. I saw it at home, and it was the extended cut, so I can't speak to the quality of the theatrical cut Did they at least keep any of the comic info the same? I heard they where going with the doomsday story line Do you mind spoilers? It's fine I am always still ok with watching something after spoilers. :D Cool. They do have Doomsday, but that plot point doesn't show up until much later. It's the bad guy behind the scenes trope.
Interesting. I think historical films like this are about the only kind that I could consider watching a second time. Okay, I see I think its more my intution. I really felt like, at times, the subtle interpersonal communications were glossed over Ha. I wouldn’t have noticed that they were “glossed over”. Still, thanks for sharing your views I tend to be a detail person so I like to dig around So, dis you aee the reviews? You are very welcome, you too

Its also crazy how an 8 year old could rig those types of traps yeah Not to the extent of the movie, but I've overslept before Catherine O'hara Haven't seen her in much lately Me neither. good actress though
Amy Adams is playing Lois lane It is about batman and superman having a battle I agree.  Jessie Eisenberg is playing is playing Lex Luthor. Its better than the man of steel. that is what the critics say  but i have not seen either one of them yet it is the first time that wonder woman was portrayed in a live action movie Thats cool superman want to expose batman via the paper clark kent works at
i love it when its nice out , i love to go ride my bikes . me too ! i just finished first in my age group in a triathlon . i have not tried competing , but i have a trainer for biking . i love to compete , especially if its something i am good at ! i am more laid back , i like to play with my three dogs i am not much of a dog person so i do not think we would get along . hat is too bad , i wonder if there is anything else in our backgrounds that mesh . i doubt it , it does not sound like we have much in common .
Then the powers go to his head Then he manipulates free will There is also a romantic part of the story about Bruce's girlfriend Grace, although he has a mild crush on his co-worker Susan Orlega (played by Catherine Bell) Sure does Yep, he uses his powers to cause all of these crazy miracles, earning his job back after he goes a bit crazy on air but has to deal with prayers from others, which are so overwhelming that he just says "yes" to all, trying to make everyone happy Does this movie sounds interesting to you? Would youi like to learn more about it? Some critics of the movie say that Jim Carrey is hilarious in the slapstick scenes, another negative critic said that Jim Carrey's hopes to become an anchor is similar to Jim Carrey's hopes to become a real actor Are you still there?
i am sure you will ! my mom was also a single mom yep like i always say if you believe it you can achieve it yes ! where i grew up it was hard in the projects of chicago ! o wow i bet it was tough ! do you like gossip ? i love it yes i do ! and shows that gossip ! me too ! people always say i am so organized
its nice you have a mom . my parents died .
o , lol , i was at a concert last night and partied a little too hard . what kind of concert ? opera is really the only type of music i listen to .
You seen toy story?
I like that Anna was fearless, and didn't act like your typical Disney princess. That's right...she's extroverted and fun! The first part of the movie, explaining how the sisters were orphaned, and how their circumstances drove them apart was tragic, but I do like how everything wrapped up in the end. It's hard to believe this is Disney's 53rd animated feature film!  I'd find it difficult to even name that many Disney animated features! Yeah, the ending has a very special meaning Do you have any other favorite film? from Disney
He can be a good Superman if given an actual good script. Yeah But I expected more from DC The action sequences were so bad too It just keeps getting worse I'm a huge DC fan. More than Marvel, but these Snyder movies are destroying the titles. Exactly Ever since snyder took over im losing interest over time Many feel the same as us if you look at the internet ratings. Anyhow Did you like the bat armour Yeah, I didn't mind the armour What about you? I feel bruce wayne did go through alot of hardwork which didn’t anyway pay off
bachelor degree in biology but the jobs are hard to find . i bet . so do you want to teach or do research ? research but in the mean time i am dabbling with a small business .
I liked that that they used extensive practical effects. The chaos is what made me love it. Do you think the fact that Harry Styles was a singer made him get the role? Nolan wasn’t aware of Styles renown as a singer so I would think that wouldn’t affect the decision. I see. Do you think Aneurin Barnard's role was a difficult one to play? I must say that with all the horror and realism from the get go this is a period piece I enjoyed more than any other. Yes I think it was. Did the small amount of dialogue make you enjoy it more? I think it helped. Did you think the role of Tommy was critical? Yes, without him Alex would've surely died. Did you feel sorry for George? Yes he was an innocent young kid. I felt Tommy and Alex were so lucky they were denied passage onto the boat. That's true, he seems really lucky. How do you think he felt being the only survivor?
i am good thanks for asking do you have animals ? i have 1 dog , 1 cat . cat is bigger than dog . o but i always wanted a pet pig pig would be fun . i wonder if one would free dive with me ? whats free diving ? never heard of it dive off cliffs into the ocean . what do you like to do ? i like listening to music
seems fun get to talk to loads of people . air force . hat is cool . do you like fishing ? ve been able to travel the world . yeah used to but feel bad . i have traveled a little bit . and you ? ll over with the job . cool . that must be fun .
No Doubt about that. But it' still family filled. Macaulay Culkin was excellent in it I always wondered what the dad did for work to afford to take the extended family to paris. Yes! Plus that house. Right? I guess that is why you could forget a kid Buzz was the perfect older brother! always picking on the younger brother. Yes. They all picked on him The mom and dad are tough but fair Plus when the mom realizes she left her baby she does the right thing You'd have thought though they could let someone know before they landed, but then I guess there'd be no movie. Could you imagine having to travel with a polka band? Exactly John Candy cameo is great in that I guess if someone is going to cheer you up it's the band and him part of me thinks it would lighten the mood a bit then as a parent I'd be annoyed cuz I just want to get home
wow potatoes are so tasty
i work as a nurse in a hospital . it is tough work i bet i could never do that i have a temper haha i do too . but i have to be patient during my 15 hour shifts oh wow 15 hours that is a lot when do you have time to eat during my breaks . i wish i had a truck to get to a fast food place though i do not eat fast food i only like certain foods what do you like to eat ? only things cooked in my own kitchen hat is really healthy . i wish i had time to do that yes it is healthy but it does take a lot of time . . . do you like music only the good kind . what is your favorite music ? like like indie music from late 90 to early 2000
The Believer. Do you know what other movies Rachel McAdams was known for?
No, I've heard of it but never watched it What's it about? it came in 2014 but I never got to see it fairy tale-it's base don Disney's sleeping beauty
o . i on the atlantic coast and live on my boat so i catch my own . fresh is probably better i am sure ! i should go visit , i would kill for some crabcakes crabs are further north but crunch crab cakes are sooo good ! so whats your favorite season ? s jane austen would say , there is nothing like the comfort of home .
do you ever travel then
oo . i am trying to do some homework but its boring . i know right ? i remember those days . its my senior year , so lots of homework . you graduate ? barely . then i worked at a coffeehouse before i got let go . y brother worked at starbucks . he got fired . hat sucks . what do you plan on doing when you graduate ? i am getting out of here . going to university of kentucky . kentucky scares me a bit . i get the impression its not so tolerant . i have never thought of that . its in the city . less rednecks ? maybe as a university town it will be better . maybe its just me .
i am in college , how about yourself ? i am vegetarian and how are you ? i am good . i spend most of my time playing football with my friends .
i just had a party for my nephew , it was zoo themed . ow old is he and did he like the it ? he is six , and he loved it ! i dressed my yorkie as a lion 3 hat is very cute lol , does he love mother russia ? haha i do not know about that but he loves bingle as much as i do you should tell him how great it is to be red instead of dead well maybe , but i think my seminar professor would disagree why is that ? would they also think being in a cult is bad ?
The whole thing starts because his dog is killed. So that's sad but satisfying to see him get revenge. I applaude that! a dog is an important part of the family! (at least for me jajajaja) hmm is the next paragraph supposed to appear now? I think so oh there we go the main bad actor is from game of thrones Alfie allen That´s Viggo carather? No it's his son
uh , it would depend on the movie i guess you could pick , whatever you want well , in general whats your favorite movie ? . . maybe superhero movies . maybe no . it depends the superhero , some of them are just overplayed hat is very rude of you to say . you cannot borrow my cape now i wear my own kind of cape , i work as a paramedic

hat would be cool . would be a nice break from the job yes , i can make you a meal with my fresh vegetables ! i love to cook . . . i lately discovered costco to shop at . . . love it i bet they do not have fresh carrots though , right ? hey do . . but not as fresh as yours i figure lol y small garden packs a mean punch !
YEP lol
hi . you any good at math ? i have a problem i cannot figure out . i am fair at math but i would love to help if i want some solar energy , it will be 10 more and my average pay is 232 . i assume you would add 23 . 20 to 232 for a total of 245 . 20 i will just cut back on french fries . you have a favorite food ? chocolate . what do you do for a living ? i am a veterinarian assistant . cool . i am a security guard . its kind a boring . do you have any pets ? i have two yellow labs . bearded collie . i just made a bed from my new sweater for him .
I don't feel that the first half was "flat and unsurprising." It had the witty banter among the children. It honestly made me feel like I could relate in a sense. Children being stuck in a big family and being completely ignored seems about right. Joe Pesci is absolutely hilarious. Maccaulay Culkin couldn't have been better chosen for the part of Kevin. I agree that the first half was entertaining. I rarely had the house to myself as a kid and loved the concept. In reality though, what kid is going to "relish" in being home alone with no way to contact your parents. They would probably be scared out of their mind. Good point, although after the initial shock I think a lot of kids would settle in and do what they had to. Normally that wouldn't necessitate bashing burglers, but that was what made the movie an adventure! All the booby traps in the movie me remind me of all the pranks my step-father used to play on us as kids. Ha! You must have had an exciting childhood! I loved it although I do wish it was a little more suspenseful. I honestly think they should do another movie with Kevin leaving his kids behind. Oh, I think that would be fun! I do usually pay attention to movie ratings when deciding to watch one, but will sometimes ignore bad ones if the plot sounds especially interesting. Do you go by ratings? My husband does. He tells me I watch some dumb stuff. I try to, but if it looks interesting to me I will watch it. I don't see a lot of stuff in the movie as realistic though. It is funny if you want a laugh though.
yes i am allergic to cats and dogs to .
reat i am looking forward to reading the most recent political thriller
o french , just a twangy southern accent but not like the fake ones on tv . so yours sounds better i take it i like art , animals and dancing and especially country music yee haw .

He directed Whiplash as well, which is another film about music. I like it because the characters are falling in love as they're following their dreams. Do you know who does the choreography for La La Land? I don't know. What kind of movies do you like? I enjoy things where I have to think. Or that have strange plot twists. Like Memento. Or Predestination. Where you don't understand everything until the very end. Are there other movies like La La Land that you could compare to it? Cool! Well then you might not like La La Land. It's a bit more straightforward and focuses more on relationships and the characters. I like all kinds of movies. Are there other films that you could compare La La Land to?
I think everyone enjoys these kind of movies There is no real age limit on this I could only assume so myself. Do you know who does the voice for the big guy with the big nose? That Gru, Steve Carell Vector is Jason Segel and Russell Brand is Dr nefano Ah gotcha. I'm terrible with names. I didn't even know Russell Brand was in it. That's cool. What's it about? Two super villains trying to attain the same goal by using some wicked tactics against each other. one of them is Gru Can't go wrong with a little bit of violence. How does the movie end? It has a good mix comedy, drama and emotions It is not very clear here I guess you will have to watch it to find out It's gotta get right into my feelings. Does anyone die? I don't know if my ol' itty bitty heart could take it. I don't think so, it ends well Always gotta have the stereotyped happy ending to leave me with feelings of bliss and joy. I'm sure my younger siblings and cousins would love it.
mine is a teacher . sometimes i have her clean for me .

Yes, I am curious to see how closely Aaron Sorkin's script follows from the book I like that biographical movies tell stories of social importance How did you like the portrayal of Zuckerberg? I thought his take was very goof Did you like David Fincher's directing? I felt like he gave a quality to the film that kept me intrigued and sucked in. Yes, I thought that the rave critical reviews were well deserved Yes, I would definitely watch another David Fincher movie. If you change something about the movie what would you change? I think I would not have cast Justin Timberlake as Sean Parker What about you? Yeah I could see that. Did you enjoy the movie overall? I would have had Zuckerberg involved with the film so that it would be more close to what actually happened. I liked the scene where Zuckerberg creates the facemash website because I thought it was funny Yeah, the crazy things people do during a breakup. But it actually was a positive thing in the end because it got him involved with those twins. Yes, it was a good thing because they were all able to work on Harvard Connection Now I want to look up Facemash to see if it still exists. That would be interesting to know. But what did you think about when they moved the company to Palo Alto?
Haha I don't even remember, I was like 13 so about 10 years ago? How time flies

I also think that Keanu Reeves does not show enough emotions (angry, sadness, grief) in the movie.  His performance is a bit bland and stoic. I think this movie is excessively violent, but I guess that's what happens when it is a story about an assassin. I agree the movie is very violent.  The movie seems to be desperating trying hard to give a reason for John Wick to kill everybody. my thoughts exactly. It also glorifies guns and violence. Yes.  I sort had to turn off my brain and try to enjoy the movie.  Why couldn't they just bought John a new dog and give back his car? Right! But then we wouldn't have a movie. I guess this movie is more focused on violent entertainment; violence for the sake of violence. It's also kind of lazy of the writers that they're using the russian mob as the antagonists. I know some russians in real life.  I would not want to mess with them.  They have told me some pretty crazy stories about living in Russia. That's what I hear. I'm not saying they are a bad choice to be in the movie, I just think it has been done too often Yeah; I sure with John's background as an assassin the writers could have come up with a better and more interesting villain. I agree. Maybe someone from his past or from his family. Even an old coworker would be more interesting than "The Russian Mob"
you should google it and check it out
gosh thats hard, it was agreat movie indeed! the story really portrays true love..do agree? i just got dumb founded on the movie at hand lol whats the name the notebook, a romantic film ok i could picture but couldnt name it, and yes it does, they have a great vibe together The performance of Ryan Gosling was stellar Do you agree with the rating of the movie? still there?
The Washington Post finally gets hold of them, but after the reporters scour through them all, their lawyers advise them not to print or face being arrested by President Nixon. That is some kind of mess Meryl Streep agonizes over whether to publish the stories or not.  If she does, it will either destroy the newspaper or make it famous. Makes sense, tough decision there Yes, one of those make or break deals.  I don't want to spoil the story and let you know what she did..... ....unless you want me to....

yes, in this movie it seems like he was trying to portray having a split personality, I wonder when will they revive superman superman can not really be killed right? he was like in some hibernated condition Yes, I don't think comics or movies killed off superman just yet, some other characters are really dead though What do you think about wonder woman and the one who played her in this movie?

I mean sure, I wonder how realistic the show biz part of this movie was ? True. Was it more about the love story or true to the hardships of the industry For me it was more a love story - I mean the ending showing "what it could be if.."  showed that it was focusing more on the romantic part - I guess that's what people are looking for these days in a movie. People do look for the romance and positive outcome. But sometimes a movie is more memorable if they dare to focus outside that box. Absolutely, but when You're making a movie like that - with dept I mean and second meaning, I sometimes think most of the audience is totally missing that. I mean I agree that Sebasian was kind of a snob and Mia's lacked of depth, but I strongly think it was intentional... there ARE snobs and no depth characters falling in love out there You know. Ha Ha yes that is true, keeping it true to real life. Even snobs fall in love. Yes ;)  I personally think he was not THAT BIG of a snob, he was just passionate and HE WAS trying to reach out to her to show her and invite her to his world. But I guess that is the beauty of the characters and the movie. People identify enough to form opinions. That means the you were invested to a degree. Therefore the movie was successful at drawing in the audience.

Yeah, and the the users gave is 8.4/10 Also very good The Metacritic score is 87/100 That is very good and the CinemaScore is an A
It has Sandra Bullock and Tim Mcgraw in it a very emotional story, she adopts a child and he ends up being really good at sports and changes his life Oh I thought it'd be like a quirky romantic comedy. It's more of a drama I see. it's based on a true story called The Blind Side Yes, usually Bulloock is in romantic comedies but this one is pretty serious and she very good I've seen the Blind Side! How are they similar? I really like that movie very emotional movie and worth seeing I think this one is even better, great story line and the cast is great! it's 2009 movie so it's definitely out there on Netflix Well if it's better than the Blind Side (which is already an A+) I'd definitely give it a try. Oh okay, it's a little older I like that. That way when I watch I can check reddit for their take on it Yes, give it a shot you won't regret it! You've convinced me, I'm gonna look it up now! Is it family friendly definitely, I cried during his film, this is great to show the kids too teaches them compassion and goodness!

hi Hello! how are u ? good, you? im ok have you seen this movie? so have u watched .. nope but i do like angelina jolie i havent either, but i love the story of sleeping beauty me too iy has 51 in rotten tomatoes so hmm not that good 5.7 out of 10. yikes i know so this movie is more about the villan is a dark fantasy film yes wow so she was originally a fairy yes i cant believe its been so long since this movie came out she fells in love with a human it says i know right and then her wings are cut off i think i only heard about this movie once oh wow ah man phillips kiss doesnt work and her lover betrayed her stefan is auroras father and maleficent loves him yea i feel bad for her now oh boy she sends stefan to his death yeah i feel bad too i know its different, but i like the old fashioned sleeping beauty too much i dont like how they changed it around yea they changed it for it to only get a 5.1 rating this film wanted to break the stereotype but it was too much righy right they fixed it when it wasnt broken yea it was too much and i havent heard about that director i wonder if this is the first movie he made he actually sounds familiar it probably takes a lot to direct a movie like this i think u are right but its metacritic score was 56/100. ow really low from what i hear angelina jolie performed really well in it well i love her im a girl not like that lol haha she is a good actress i think she is a great person and actres there is a scene where aurora is a little girl and she goes up to maleficent and they had to use Angelinas daughter oh really ??? because her daughter was the only one who wouldnt get scared and run away lol so i like that
I do not agree with any of the scores, besides CinemaScore No real mother would not miss her young child until mid flight, that part is totally unbelievable. That is totally true And it is very unlikely that most 8 year olds would not be scared out of their minds if that happened to them. You are right again, but then there would be no movie. ;) I think it would have seemed more realistic too if the father was the one who made the trip back to collect Kevin. It just seems like a fatherly thing to do considering the distance. Perhaps, but then it shows the mom's determination Even though up to the point of him getting left behind, the family seemed to be totally against him. I think this scene should have made Harry and Marv think twice about trying to break into anyone else's house. What do you mean? Yeah, I think they all thought he was a bit of a brat. That part was realistic. Well, Harry and Marv got totally outsmarted by an 8 year old who gave them all kinds of trouble.
oh , it is ! i do it on the island i live on . oh wow . my boys and i live near mountains . oh . do you have any pets ?
It has to be the dragon Hiccup, he is so funny at times Who was your favourite? I think the boy's name is Hiccup. :) I liked him, I can't remember the dragon's name :) Toothless? Is that the dragon? Silly me, I thought the dragon was called Hiccup! Possibly that was the Dragons name l love how much better animation has gotten. It's really enjoyable to watch, not like the clunky stuff when I was a kid. What I like most about these movies is the animation behind it, how the 3D captures your attention Me too. And it's amazing that they can create facial expressions on animals or fantasy beings, which make you identity with them. We thought the same thing at the same time :D Pixar has been doing a really good job at making these movies really watchable Can you believe that this movie came out in 2010?
yeah i am , i love throwing parties
he animals and wide open space . i live in a small apartment now . oo ! panting does not pay enough for an average sized apartment least you are creative ! i love doing beadwork with my own patterns .

hat would be great then you could be my freind i have a lot sweet , i need more friends than the pigs ! i can understand that it must be boring yes , can i come visit you . i will not make you eat vegetarian haha lol that sounds like a lot of fun
I don't really know what the snow queen is all about I immediately think of Snow White, wasn't she the snow queen? Interesting I don't recognize any of the names they have doing voices.  Sometimes it is fun to recognize a voice. Yeah! Elsa suppresses her magic rather than mastering it. Which causes insecurity. and she has to shut her sister out. I have no clue about the names listed either Arendelle? is that a real place? I doubt it It must be truly magical watching this in 3D. I would imagine it is pretty cool.  I like how they say that you can picture the broadway play right there while watching the movie. Renewed cultural relevance? Were they feeling ancient 53rd Disney animated feature.  How many of those 53 have you seen? Who was the iceman. Not sure, but Marshmallow doesn't sound like someone to mess with. Not many! Marshmaollow!!! That's a funny name The trolls and Grand Pebble are Kristoff's adoptive family?  What? that seems a little far fetche d It must be pretty cold leaving in ice. I would hate it. Yeah not something I would want
why is that ? i like to do all my shopping there i really like pizza and their pizza is gross
No I do not think they would enjoy it But there is nothing explicit about it Just boring to kids? What was your favorite part? Yeah they probably would not get it When they were able to get Alan's machine working I felt so happy for them Who are the actors in the movie? alright ;et me see I know the guy from Sherlock Holmes is in it Benedict Cumberbatch Oh okay I like him Keira Knightley too She's great those are the only 2 I remember right now
Thats always great as a fan of the Matrix trilogy. Do you happen to know if there is a sequel to this movie as well? Yep, there is one, I believe it came out last year. It was really solid, as well Super cool, something that can captivate for longer than one movie is fantastic. It certainly does that I'm not sure what else we are supposed to do.... I am just waiting to be able to go look up this movie lol I do not want to spoil the details of it for you What rating does this movie have? Such as, PG 13, R, etc?
i do not i love people especially my friend abigail hat is good so young i am an accountant i have to stop that you make a lot of money ?
yes thats cool so should i check this film out
My sister was, and both of my kids are. Tim McGraw was good in it too... not what I expected. I'm surprised it wasn't rated higher. Look at you all admirable and such. So I don't recall, but did they key at all on the racial aspects of that or as it less obvious? No, I'm the lucky one! ..... I think they did some. In the old Rotten tomatos feel good movies never go too high. It such a sad norm now for so many kids going in to foster care due to drug issues with their parents. This story had a great outcome unlike most really do. Around here the parents get the kids into the drugs, woiw The NFL thing is sort of the Holy Grail in Tennesee I like sports movies Yeah, that happens here too. I wonder how closely The Blind Side followed the true events. I don't think she was as easy on him as the Bullock character, a bit more like the Dragon Mom

true, and the director is pretty notable It came out in 2010 The fact that it is a true story about Facebook makes it even more interesting. I know... it was named movie of the year in 2010 I didn't even know there were lawsuits involved in the creation of FB It is weird that neither Zuckerberg nor any other Facebook staff were involved with the project. yeah right? It was created in such a unique way It's drama so if you like that genre, then this is for you

I think it's amazing how packed this movie was considering it was only 106 minutes. I agree, I was really interested in checking it out being a fan of war movies, especially WWII settings, and I certainly wasn't disappointed. Christopher Nolan doesn't seem to ever disappoint! Agreed! I thoroughly agree with the 92% rating, Did you see it in IMAX? The 70mm screen was impressive. Same here, I typically look at metacritic over rotten tomatoes, and sometimes they can vary vastly in their ratings, but even on metacritic it got a 94! Yes, the critical ratings were very consistent. I didn't see it in imax, unfortunately, as there aren't any near me, but seeing it in regular theatre was just as good. Fionn Whitehead being cast as the lead was absolutely perfect. He knocked his character, Tommy, out of the park. Agreed. I think it was a clever move to name him Tommy to make him more representative of the average person. I really enjoy how there's not a whole lot of dialogue in the movie. It definitely creates a very suspensful setting engaging the audience with just the sights and music. The use of time period specific things, like boats that participated in the evacuation was also a nice touch as well. They certainly went all out in making sure this movie was a hit. I especially like their use of practical effects--Nolan's a champ at that. So much better than trying to use CGI for everything! George going blind and everything that resulted from that was so sad; I can't imagine what that was like. The scene where they find a wounded man after the German dive-bomber attack I found very interesting. When they rushed his stretcher onto a hospital shit but weren't allowed to board the ship themselves, just think if they were allowed on and then perished when it was sunk by that torpedo. Whole different ending in many ways. Yeah, for sure. I liked how they built up the suspense for something so simple as just getting a stretcher onto a ship. The constant beats of finding safety and losing it again definitely drives the story forward. They also almost never went to Dunkirk. After they rescued that officer from the wrecked ship and he tried to turn them around. That was a pretty pivotal point in the movie.
yeah , its alright . i am gonna teach calculus at camp next summer cool . i am a paper salesman

i love rap music my favorite artist is jay z s o do you work ? yes but i resigned because my boss is bad oh wow ! ! i work with my friends at a hospital
I haven't yet, what do you think about it? It's a really good movie. It It's a biographical drama about the creator of Facebook Oh? Do you know any of the actors playing in it? Yeah, it has Jesse Eisenberg as Mark Zuckerberg, Andrew Garfield as his friend who sort of co-founded it, and Justin Timberlake That sounds exciting! What goes on in the movie? Well a lot, haha. It's pretty much about getting Facebook to be a successful social media website, and meanwhile, Mark Zuckerberg is battling a few legal lawsuits between a few characters. How true is it to real life? Well given that the actual people in real life didn't really contribute to the movie, I have to imagine a lot of it is dramatized and takes liberties in a lot of areas to make a more dramatic movie. But I do know that a lot of it is pretty accurate. Of course, they would have to dramatize a bit to make a real life situation more interesting. Has anyone given it good reviews? Yeah it's gotten a lot of good reviews. Some called it the best movie of the year, Metacritic gave it a 95/100, and CinemaScore gave it a B+ I trust RottenTomatos a bit more, did they provide a score? Yeah, they gave it a 96% Good to know. Who do you feel would be the best audience to see this? Would it better for my teenaged daughter or more for Friday date night?

The irony of mr. big being a tiny rat/mouse was pretty comical the unrealistic expectation of 10 hours being left to solve the case really put the pressure on judy and nick I thought it was also kind of Nick to defend Judy when Chief Bogo wanted to fire her yeah with no leads he still had faith in her And the back story of Nick was touching, you got to understand how he became a con man

hello hello Have you seen Great Gatsby? yes i was seen It was a great movie What about the cinema score?Do you think it deserves the B Cinema score is very good yes definitely deserve it. What do you think about Leonardo DiCaprio as Jay Gatsby ? Did he do a good job? i enjoyed alot yes he did a very well job Did you know that the movie was based on 1925 novel by Scott Fitzgerald? i think so Some critics say that this was a trashy opera of the emotional extravagance What do you think about the girl Daisy played by Carey Mulligan? Great stories Ok.What do you think about the scene when Jay Gatsby tells Tom that he was having an affair with his wife Daisy? yes wife curious about daisy and she is right I feel for Nick Carraway, he is a World War I veteran, who was receiving treatment for alcoholism. What about stand out actor Joel Edgerton as Tom Buchanan? He played well. Despite his flat one dimensional character. very well The ratings are not very good, though. 5.8 out of 10 But the movie was very good I think so as well. Do you know anything about director Baz Luhrmann? I have never heard of him before? Do you? Yes he was a great director What about genre of this movie? Do you like to watch romantic movies, dramas?
i read a lot and do activist stuff it was nice talking to you my grandkids are here now
I'm trying to think of anything else to say about this movie or the scenes but honestly it's not an easy one to talk about. I don't actually remember much about the end of the movie, I could stand to rewatch it if I had more time
have you read anything about baseball ? my children and i play it often ! i have not recently . i also like technology ything particular ? i enjoy the medical technology since i recently became a doctor . i love phones and computers . i also create websites what kind of websites ? i am currently on one looking at mountains ! my favorite place ! i like to create game websites and estate websites sounds interesting ! man , my ankle is killing me . hurt it climbing a mountain once . is the weather making it hurt ? definitely . luckily my wife , who is a trained nurse , can help .
rock on . i stay at home and sell clothes on facebook . cool . are you religious ? i have not told my parents i am wiccan yet .
It's based on a book called The Blind Side. The movie has the same name. I highly recommend it. Can you tell me what it's about? It sounds interesting and I like Sandra Bullock! The story is about a child's impoverished upbringing. In the book he gets adopted and later in life become a pro football player. Awesome! I love films revolving around the subject of sports and overcoming harsh upbringings. Who else co-stars in it? Um... Quinton Aaron is the child. And Tim McGraw plays Sandra Bullock's wife. Rotten Tomatoes only gave it 6.1/10 but I would have rated it more like an 8. Really? Tim McGraw the country singer? I had no idea he acted! I'd love to see how he performs as an actor! Often times, Rotten Tomatoes can't be relied upon so I'll take your personal rating over theirs. Do you know what other critics said about the film? Yeah; I didn't even realize it was Tim McGraw. He was great.Other critics liked it and especially liked Sandra Bullock's role. The story is really great. The poor kid has been in all different foster families and keeps running away.
Hi how's it going? Pretty good. Did you like the movie Jaws? I really don't like it. I think the introduction about Jaws is pretty accurate. Jaws is a great movie. A classic. However I think we're supposed to use only the information given, as though we know nothing about it. Oh, I'm sorry I meant I don't like this type of movies. Do you? Reading the reviews at left, it's not a movie I would rush out to see. I don't usually like "horror" movies. do you agree with the rating in rotten tomatoes? Yeah I think so. The movie was innovative. Nothing like that had ever been done before. Yea it's 1975, and people back thinks sharks attack human out of of the blue. then* I really don't enjoy watching that scene when a girl got pulled down to go skinny dipping. Yeah I don't agree that viewers don't feel sympathy for the shark's victims, that's for sure. I'm wondering when we get to move on to the next document. yea, I mean why would the coroner thinks she was killed by a boat accident I loved Robert Shaw, the shark hunter. Huh, a shark hunter. didn't know he was a shark hunter I don't really blame the mayor proclaiming the beaches are safe. in that one scene Well he had to have the tourist traffic. I mean yea sure he cares about the money coming in, but sharks rarely do attack human. The whole plot of the story is a bit silly. The scene when the town hires Quint to go out and catch the shark is good. That is the first scene when you see him and he is a good character. So they hired a "shark hunter." So this Quint guy knows all about a shark? Why  can't they hire a shark specialist instead. Well they did hire the oceanographer also, and the two of them had funny interactions. They didn't exactly look at things from the same perspective. That last paragraph makes it sound really dumb.
i should pick up a simpler past time like you .

Hello! Hello there. How are you? I was just reading about the movie La La Land. Have you seen it? No, what is it about? I would love to watch it, may I have more information about it? If you are into musicals, it is a really classical approach to a new age musical. It stars Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone as two people trying to find their way in Los Angeles.
Yeah it's about this guy named Jay Gatsby and he's a billionaire He throws all kinds of wild parties at his place
i am just chatting a bit for i go fishing . how are you ? i am good , just studying up a bit i never study , no need in my job at the deli counter .
What's the name of the movie? The Blind Side Oh yeah. What did you like about it? This movie based on the 2006 book, The Blind Side, is a sports tear-jerker. An African-American boy lives with his siblings and Mom who is a drug addict. When he was little he and his siblings were eventually taken away from her and separated. The boy's name is Michael or 'Big Mike' as everyone calls him. Because well as he grows up he's a big kid. Big Mike pretty much raises himself with no help at all and sleeping on friends couches. In high school he has one set of clothes which he washes everynight. He attends school but pretty much does not have have the support to do well in school but it gave him a break from being alone. He could have given up at any time or worse turned to crime or drugs like his Mother. Big Mike is played by Quinton Aaron who portrayed him very well.
I really liked it. It was interesting to see how Facebook was first founded. It was, do you usually like biographical movies like this one? Yes, I tend to like biographical movies, they usually provide a fascinating look into the life of the subject in the movie. I agree, I was very surprised to learn the Winklevoss twins were played by a single actor. That’s what caught my eye too! I honestly thought they were just a set of twins playing the characters, I wouldn’t have ever guessed that they were played by just one individual. He was very convincing as two different people! I was also surprised to learn so many lawsuits were involved in the creation of Facebook. Yeah the actor did a great job as the twins. I didn’t realize either before I saw the film how many lawsuits were brought against Zuckerberg after he founded the site. I also enjoyed Jesse Eisenberg's performance, he played Zuckerberg how I had always imagined him I love Jesse Eisenberg as an actor, so it was great to see him in a starring role. I hadn’t ever really thought much about Zuckerberg before I saw the movie, but I feel like Eisenberg played him perfectly - a really smart guy, but somewhat cold to most of the other people in his life and cocky about his success. That's how I had thought of him, smart and arrogant but kind of reclusive. I was also unaware and surprised to learn about the whole Facesmash website that happened before the idea for Facebook came around. It's interesting to see how Facesmash evolved into Facebook,

Well, then I have a treat for you! I would recommend the film John Wick. It's the best action movie out there and it's 4 years old. What is it about? The story follows a man named John Wick, which is played by Keanu Reeves who is an ex hitman that is trying to live a normal life after his wife dies. It sounds interesting! It's actually pretty good story wise. I really don't want to spoil it for you. I think its a refreshing for the guys because there isn't any of the fluff you see in other movies. It not your basic shoot everyone kind of film, every action has a purpose and I think thats is what I enjoy the most. If you like Keanu Reeves you'll love him in this film

Yeh, Looks like a fun movie to see with the kids and I love Tom Hanks The characters are different and it's a lively film. T Tom Hanks is great! Was very modern for a 1995 film I love how creative it was. And Pixar animations are always great They are! The animation is top notch and the story is always good. Mr potato head is my favorite actor I had one when I was a child Mr Potatohead was awesome! And the rating in all sites are pretty high I love the adventure and elements of danger the toys had to endure throughout the film. Yes, and also how they stop the action when humans show up It's a captivating story and so funny! I can't see the end of your sentenc... When do they stop the action? Oh! The humans show up! Yes! Hilarious!!! Have you seen that Steve jobs was the executive producers? One of them I've always like Wallace Shawn, the voice of T Rex. He did a great job of bringing that plastic dinosaur to life in this movie. Very interesting! I didn’t know it I didn't see that about Steve Jobs. Is in the introduction box

i usually don't go purely on the ratings, they are very often biased. I prefer asking friends who have seen the movie and then decide if I want to watch it Good point. I have seen "bad movies" (according to critics) and they ended up being quite good. This movie could be decent. It seems to have gotten mixed reviews Do you know the overall plot of the movie? Not sure Maybe that could be a good reason to rent a DVD or per per view and watch it Very true! The basic plot seems to be Lex Luthor pitting Batman against Superman. I'm not sure why they distrust each other though That kind of has me curious to watch it It seems like Lex kidnaps Martha Kent to force Superman to kill Batman It could be interesting to watch two superheroes against each other. As a child, I watched more of Superman than Batman
i love listening to sounds of nature and different animal sounds how about you blues and jazz are my favourites i love animals , sometimes more than people , how about you ? i prefer people , it helps with the bar weekend job i prefer to be outside searching for wildlife fairs , i am training to be a lawyer during the weel hat sounds awesome i visit animal shelters in my frequently just to help out i spend my free time collecting scotch

I remember the name but I've never seen it myself What kind of ratings did it get? not sure maybe 4 Okay! It sounds like a good movie I imagine Morgan Freeman was the voice of God Director was Tom Shadyac Yes lol I also like Jim Carrey I just don't know a whole lot about him But he seems funny and perfect for a movie like this

So do you always watch movies with a good score? This one had a 92% rating on rotten tomatoes I liked the scene where Tommy reads out Churchill's address to the nation. still there?
Is the movie set in present day? No it's in 1987 Cool, so is it based on true events? Yes. It's about Jordan Belfort. Some Keys scenes of the movie are when he gets ajob as a stock broker in wall street and his employer Mark Hanna quickly entices him for sex and drugs and fueld there cultureas stock brokers and teaches him howto make money forhimself I think I'll go rent it on Friday.  Hopefully Blockbuster has a copy on VHS, because I haven't splurged on a DVD player yet. I think they are remodeling in my town though, it is taking forever the front sign has been down for years... do you know who might have a copy?
ice ! i am at work , i am a cpa in a big firm hat is awful having to work on sunday ! do you like it ? yes ! in my spare time i am trying to find my biological parents y mom is greek ! i hope you can find your parents . i love my adopting ones , wish they had adopted more than myself . re you an only child then ? its cool knowing your biological history too though . yeah , maybe that is why i cannot be in a loving relationship . i hope you can find them ! i am indian and greek .
yea but still a classic we haven't seen a new movie from him in awhile of this caliber plus it showed a good message what was the message you got from it? that we can' can' can't just get what we want that is true, there is always a consequence we have to work for it yes, but potrayed in a light hearted way like the part where everyone got the winning lottery numbers and they only won 4 dollars yes that was a great jab I also like how he was sweeping showing to me how me was cleaning up other messes yea, he was trying to do a lot to make others feel better or make life better yes and at the end how he realized that even though he did not get his wish but others are happy yea - trying to help too many people and thinking it's never enough
possible , i listen to everything from 80s to country
wesome . what do you do with your dolls ?
i am sure you would look great in a swimsuit . guess i could buy a big one .
How long is the movie? Yea, about that, the movie is a bit long at 2.5 hours but overall I would say it's a must see. That’s not too bad. Is there plenty of action to keep you entertained?
hey sure are a handful ! all they eat is asparagus since i do not like it
oh . i have three brothers and i am the youngest . i would not like that at all . i do not like change .
lways good for a laugh , even on the worst days bsolutely and lucky for me the internet loves cat photos he true fundamental purpose of the internet is cat sharing
The argument that ended their relationship seemed quite believable to me, you? If I was a musciian I would be ok with playing music I didn't really care for if it paid the bills... lol, and the ending I'd be okay with playing most music, for sure. At least it is music. Better than being a starving burger-flipping musician that plays gigs a few times a month.
yeah that is cool , do you live with your brother kind of , i breed cats , main coon breed , then show them ! hat is cool we have a pet cat
its time to do what ? ime to retire ! so i can work on my baking skill ok , i understand now . then you are cook ? o , i am a gaffer . i tried to make it as an actor but had to settle d now what do you intend to do ? spend some time with my beautiful kiddos how many do you have i have 3 boys and 3 girls you have an excellent family hanks ! they are great kids . i love them so much soon i will follow you you are planning a family ?

yes of course i am ! i am pretty popular in the race world .
pretty close to ontario , you ? orth carolina . they have the best bbq that i eat almost every day .
Entertaining indeed.  I see that it has an almost all female line up which means that fashion and other female issued probably dominated the story line. Have you seen the movie? Yes I have, many times, it somewhat of a classic. So does the film address the benefits of a female high school clique? It address the awareness of high school cliques, but not in a positive light. Got it.  So what do you think the classification of "Plastics" really embodies? Resemblance or characteristics of a barbie doll, because their made from plastic, it could ask mean fake. also mean* Oh, I do get it now.  Is is me or does Hollywood continue to make films where the queen bee is always rich? and not middle, working or lower class? Yea I agree, even today's show the queen be is still wealthy, soiled or fortunate. And I do get how Cady would respond positively to being accepting into the in group. However, what I dont don't get is what Janis is upset about? They just like drama I guess she wants to get even. Am I correct in assuming that the Burn Book is a book filled with lies and made up stories or is it a black book of past sins and transgression done by student and teachers? It's a book filled with lies and past sins

It is a fantasy drama about a mute women who forms a bond and falls in love with an amphibian creature. Oh that definitely sounds different. It has a 92% on Rotten Tomatoes and stars Sally Hawkins, Michael Shannon, Richard Jenkins, and Octavia Spencer. It also takes place in Baltimore in 1962. Thank you! I was just about to ask that next!  I don't think I know any of those actors It is "one of del Toro's most stunningly successful works..." This sounds like a good movie, I've always liked stuff from that time period Wow! That's a great review Do you know if it's a long movie? And what it's rated? I'm not sure but there are several key scenes in the movie. In one of them the main character Elisa Esposito communicates with the animal through sign language. Interesting! And this is the animal she falls in love with? Yes the amphibian creature is the animal she falls in love with. She also ends up having sex with the creature in her apartment bathtub. Wow! Well that's shocking and different This has piqued my curiosity it sounds like something I might have to check out! Yes quite different hah!  The creature also at some point heals her neighbor and gives the neighbor his hair back simply through touch.

Okay for kids? I think so. There is some talk about drugs because of his mother's addiction. I think it has a really positive meaning though. Did it win any awards? I don't remember. The critics praised Sandra Bullock's performance though. I do like her. I don't think I've seen Tim McGraw in anything though. I don't know if I ever have either. Jae Head plays the little brother and Lily Collins plays the sister but I don't know if they have been in anything else either. It is directed by John Lee Hancock. Don't recognize those names either. Which is fine. If somebody says something is good I'l check it out no matter who is in it. It is one of those movies that if it is on I watch it. I think it is a great story. How long is it? I would guess about 2 hours.
So true! He's a brilliant director and this was the best thriller I believe I've ever seen! I didn't know Amity Island was a fictional New England resort town either! I do think he truly managed to make the camera "be the shark" rather than showing the shark all the time. Amity Island seemed so much like it could be any small town with real problems. I agree. As one critic note, "Spielberg is blessed with talent".  Truer words have never been spoken! The beach party scene where Chrissie goes skinny dipping was so freaky! Yes it's amazing how much talent he has and I believe he was mostly self taught. Also I think it's very true how we don't really feel for the victims very much... Agreed. Brody had every right to close those beaches. It's too bad greed forced the Mayor to overrule him.
in my day , that would have been me . i love my grandbabies a lot . ow many do you have ? four . and it feels like twenty sometimes haha . lol i bet that brings a lot of fun times it does . lots of great memories . life is too short to not enjoy the little moments . i totally agree , that is why i eat healthy and exercise more ood thinking , that is the way to go .
what is your favorite movie i got thick beard but bald hat must be easy to care for my job requires to wear nice clothings
was it graphic, like lots of blood and guts? can you respond a little quicker please Yes. Graphic. Little dialogue. Visually gripping but pretentious like an impressionist painting. how are impressionist paintings pretentious? That is my impression. were there any famous actors or actresses in it? It's not long though. 106 minutes, ok, that is pretty short for a war movie have you heard any reviews of it? No one famous in it. Fionn Whoitehead. Never heard of him bbefore. Jack Lowden Great reviews from critics. But critics like artsy stuff. They were deeply moved. Is it better than Saving Private Ryan?

Well, when I watched it, I actually fell asleep halfway. I'm really not into war movies either but I gave it a shot. It had very little dialogue which made it very confusing to understand. the movie kept directing it back and forth to different scenes which made it so hard to follow Yeah, from what I've read in the  introduction, it appears they didn't use much sound.  I can somewhat understand the reasoning, but don't think it would make it much more interesting or easy to follow. I think the actors look decent in it though. Honestly, one of the reasons I decided to watch it was because Harry Styles was in it. But the acting was also done horribly. I'm not sure how it got 92% on rotten tomatoes I might have to give it another try I see that Rotten Tomatoes gave it that, but I don't trust them at all.
hi , i am william . do you thrash that hair ? then metallica is right for you ! yes . it is down to my knees ! but it is hard to dance with this hair rly ! rock on ! i could imagine , the strain . but no pain no gain . xactleee . . oops i am not great at spelling lol no worries . so whats you are favorite food ? italian for sure . i am a sucker for red sauce ! and you ? rice with chicken . no doubt . yellow rice preferred ! yes with saffron ! its my go to rice most of the time !

I will surely look anyway I think it's kind of cool that elisa is a mute, it really makes for an interesting movie because it emphasizes story beyond all else. Yes I don't like that Pandora, the cat gets eaten though. I hate that :(
hat would be awesome ! my dads a police officer hat is awesome ! i am also an artist , on my spare time . me to i love to use red i love the color baby blue i volunteer at nursing homes and paint ice , do you like volunteering there ? its nice to see there smiles yes yes awesome ! is your family there too ?

they gave it 48% Oh, my, they must have disliked it! What's the general plot line? Its about a mysterious millionaire and a love triangle. Oh, two great concepts. Where does it get sticky? The girl has to chose between two guys Ah. Then what?
oh I didn't know that that is interesting a also didn't know  nIck was a veteran yes that's interesting. I like it when Nick rents a house near Gatsby's mansion and I agree with the last critical response Joel Edgerton portrayed Tom Buchanan really well There is something about this bootlegging business.. and there we have Nick suffering from alcoholism Oh you liked Joel Edgerton's portrayal? you have a good taste ! I felt the movie had too much drama with affairs and stuff yup he seemed like a good choice as a upper class socialite yes there were the whole movie was basically all about affiair between Daisy and Gatsby Yes and well that is the reason Joel Edgerton hates Gatsby I like the scene where Gatsby is waiting for Daisy to show up at the party he hosted Oh yes. Did you like the dynamics between Gatsby and Daisy characters? I did they had a good chemistry I quite agree. I like their character development although the scnee where Gatsby was killed wasn't my favourite
oh okay . i love eating food and working out . any pets ? i have a dog named bella and a cat named sookie . out ! so do i ! you dance ?

okay , do you cook ? i love all kinds of food except green beans . people say i cook great steak is my specialty
Yes, I did. I think infiltrating dream is completely brilliant because you can do so much with it. There aren't rules, so to speak. It really feels like this could happen in real life almost. Don't you think? Yeah, it has just enough sci-fi to make it interesting, but leaving the rest as normal as possible. How did you liked the scene where they start to infiltrate the dreams of Robert Fisher ? I really liked how they explained the kick system. Precisely. Did you like that Fischer basically armed himself against attack in his subconscious? I think these concepts get us thinking while watching. Yeah, it made the film more realistic and gave the film more tension. I did too. I think the kick system is super fascinating! It made me think about how long it may have taken them to figure out how to do that, you know after perhaps lots of people getting stuck! Right, more action. What do you think about the concept of the totem? It's so visceral, literally!
ood do you work anywhere i am an attorney . cool do you eat meat i do but sometimes it gets in my beard . ross i am a vegan more power to you . power to the people i say i wear power suits all the time for work . not necessarily vegan . like iron man power suits ? ot quite . nice clothing since i am in court alot . oh iron man is way cooler i do enjoy his humor . yeah he is quite witty
Hello Hey What movie are we supposed to discuss? The Note Book oh, okay. I've seen that one. But it was a while back. I can;t really remember how it ended yes it came out  in 2004 Yeah, I know it is a sad romance. but I can't remember too many details about it. Can you? It was based on a 1996 novel by Nicholas Sparks. How did it end? they died in their sleep together. I hate movies that end like that. I think that is Nicholas Sparks' specialty Same here, I agree What is your favorite movie genre? I like more Drama movies Like urban stories I'm more into action. What was the last movie you saw in theaters? Last movie I saw was 50 Shades Freed I wanted to see that one. Was it any good? The last one I saw was Black Panther It was okay, a lot more action in this one. Yea I still need to see it. It was so good. and yeah I liked the first 50 shades movie but the second one was kind of boring. I was hoping the third was better than both of them Yea I think this was the last one, so no more after that. Most movies come from novels, like this one. Yeah, and now I'm looking forward to seeing Red Sparrow with Jennifer Lawrence. Have you heard of that one? No I haven't, what is it about> It's about a girl that gets recruited to this "Sparrow" program that trains gifted young women to become spies and master decption. It's supposed to be really good. I think that's what its about but I could be worng Sounds interesting, I've not sure I know who Jennifer Lawrence is What other movies have she played in? Have you ever seen the hunger games?
Hey the movie is The Wolf of Wall Street Have you seen it? Great movie Tell me about it! Its lead actor is Leonardo Dicaprio as Jordan Belfort Nice, who else plays in it? Its an all start cast and director. Margot Robbie is in it, Jonah Hill and Martin Scorsese directed it. Oh I like Jonah Hill What ratings did it get? The movie is based off a guy name Jordan Belfort. It depicts Belforts career as a broker and his firm which conducted lots of pump and dump schemes on wall street. Interesting The movie was graded as average by many critics but I thought it was much better than it. What was its rotten tomato score The movie was thrilling as it was comedic. Critics rated as average. Rotten tomatoes gavie it a grade of 7.8/10. Meltacriti 75/100 and Cinema Score gave it a C. Sounds pretty good Yes it is lots of drugs, sex, alcohol. Pretty much a rock n roll life style as a fraudulent stock broker. Is there a lot of cursing? It doesn't sound like a family movie Definitely not a movie for kids one of my favorite scenes is when Jordan Belfort and Jonah Hill took too many quaaludes and he had to get in his Ferrari and drive it back to his home. it was a very funny scene..

Yeah, I always wanted to leave near a beach to visit often, but unfortunetly I do not, only visit the shore during the summer *live Well, if you had a police chief like Brody Martin, he coould attempt to close the beaches to keep everyone safe This movie was a huge success, but made tons of bad choices trying to do sequels of this film. yes, they should have stuck closer to peter benchly's original novel Robert Shaw as the shark bounty hunter Quint is a terrific character Nothing beats a grumbling sea captain Always singing sea songs and drinking with the Police chief And the shark itself. I would describe it a s a sizable great white Yeah, the newer "Thriller" shark movie, The Shallows is a great modern shark movie well I wouldn't call it a scare machine that works like computer like precision, like some critics For it's time it was scary, and one of a kind. Nothing beats the classics

How long is the movie? It is the perfect length. The 3D computer-animation is also a musical, so the kids will sing along. Kids do love musicals. I will have to get some popcorn and candy ready! Yes, Idina Menzel sings as Elsa and she got great reviews. Is it called Frozen because they live in the snow?

Not sure that I've heard of him before. Did you have any favorite scenes in the movie? There is a scene when Maleficent is young and her past lover betrays her and cuts off her wings.  Then Maleficent finds a raven named Diaval to be her wings, spy, and confidant.  She even transforms Diaval into different forms as needed, including human. Wow, that sounds exciting. It sounds very interesting. I bet the scenery was stunning Yes, it is a blend of CGI.  Lots of levitating cliffs and odd flora.  Still has all the depth of the old matte-painted backgrounds of the analog days. What score would you personally give it?

Wow that seems like a huge twist! Are there any really negative reviews from any critics? It seems Maleficent is actually a fairy living in area near humans. Wow that sounds pretty interesting! While the king is dying, he offers his kingdom to whoever kills Maleficent. Sounds like a very interesting plot Are you planning to watch this movie in the future? Yeah, one guy drugs Maleficent and cuts off her wings which is lethal to fairies. Oh that's terrible! I might watch it with my daughter. Based on the information you provided, I actually feel like I want to see this movie now Maleficent gets her revenge in the end. It seems she actually becomes a dark character. Wow that sounds intriguing! Are there any other interesting facts about the movie?

Well jeez, that reviewer must not have enjoyed the film using a word like "treacle"! What role does Jen Anniston play? It doesn't really say, just says her characters name is Gracey Connelly. Oh, there it is, she plays Bruce's(Jim Carrey's character) girlfriend. Oh, very nice, I like her in comedy movies so I'm sure she's great. What's the plot of the movie? Steve Carrell is in it as well, and that's the Bruce's breaking point.  Bruce plays a newsreporter aspiring to become a new anchor, and hits his breaking point when he gets passed over for the job by rival reporter Steve Carrell (who plays Evan Baxter. Sounds funny! Always good to have rivalry in comedy, especially with those two actors cause they are both hysterical in their own right. Did you have any favorite moments from the film? I think the whole movie is pretty good After complaining to God, God gives Bruce all the powers of being God.
well it is inspiring that you did something about it . i wish you luck .

Yes i enjoyed it, have you?
I wouldn't say that it's not a major film, but i would say it's different to much of his other work. What would you rate it out of 10? I can agree to that 8 for sure I can definitely agree with the rotten tomatoes 7.9 score Do you agree with them comparing this movie with Gangs of New York? Yeah i'd also give it around an 8. The acting was great, i'm also a big fan of Tom Hanks. I think Gangs of New York was much more complex and deep, this film seemed very light and i agree that it was comical Me too. But I hate how the critics did this movie. The one stating it was bogged down over 140 minutes. Definitley false. This movie was super interesting to me Yes it was comical. This man was a white colar criminal genious especially for back in those days to come up with this kind of scam is unheard of I think the content of the film always kept you guessing, it definitely didn't feel like 140 minutes Is this one of your favourite DiCaprio films? No not at all and the other comment about it taking off like a hare on speed and ends like a winded tortoise is completely false in my opinion as well No not one of my favorites. But definitely one of the most interesting fact wise I definitley think they hit the key scenes on the nail though. His father dieing is so critical
it helps me blame the system , instead of myself .
i am organizing my dragon ball z collection really ? because milena is my favorite mortal combat character !

80 even hahaha Any favorite part of the movie? The key scene in the document for me that stands out was Malifecent and Stefan in the tower. Right, that scene was intense, I feel like that was the climactic part of the movie. Yes, although I feel like this movie would definitely confuse a lot of people plot wise if you wont be paying much attention to it. Definitely, too much going on, maybe thats why it got a low rating.
d bring as many friends as you like , i do not really have friends , but i appreciate that you would allow that .

Who is the director of this? Jon Favreau He also acts, right? he got too fat to act so he had to start directing heheheheheheh and the cast ?? Robert Downey Jr is iron man Terrence Howard is his buddy Gwyeneth Paltrow is his assistant/love interest I wish genius billionaire playboy and what is this movie about? origins? that's how he is described yeah, he designs his suit in this one learns to use it does another avenger appear? or what's the story about? some guy builds another suit no other avengers so some evil guy builds a suit and steals this nuclear reactor from Tony Stark they fight it out of course it had really good special effects ohh right .. It's like a duel against its opposite ...? I think Tony Starks suit was better Iron man ends up knocking evil guy into this reactor it explodes good guys win great..!!And what do the critics of this movie think?
i know they made a bunch of sequels so it must be popular Yes a lot of kids love the movies i remember when toy story came out and it got great reviews i think i would watch this movie Yeah everybody still loves those movies.

I like Amy Adams, but she just didn't fit as Lois either. Normally, he's very good. But the script here made him more bonkers, and less calculating. True. So we are blaming the script writers? I wonder who wrote it Does a score this low put you off or make you want to see for yourself? Eh. I never trust critics so I would watch it anyway I just wouldn't take my son until I've screened it first They were actually right on about 90% of the criticism I think it was a bit dark for kids. Though I did like one thing a lot. They address the massive destruction in Man Of Steel That's what I'm thinking. I always screen dc movies first because they are dark. I let him watch wonder woman though It's the one valid reason Batman has for thinking Superman was dangerous. I never even thought about that. Hmm So Batman goes off the deep end over superman messily saving the world? It's a weak premise That was the thing the critics pointed out. The level of destruction during the battle killed people in those buildings. He does. And the bigotry angle of "What does this alien want here?" I'd say it's better than the whole city dying...
Yes it a family friendly movie that is an animation movie.
oh ok lol . what do you do for a living i train seals at sea world . yourself ? wow that is cool ! i use to drive semis but now i fix them . i wish i was good at mechanics , those bills are high ! he parts cost the most . well she is ready to go was nice talking to you

I guess it woudnt be a bad idea to Google the movie and see what it is about. I wouldn't mind seeing it sonce it has Tom Hanks in it. He's funny Google is a good idea. do you have a favorite movie site to shcek? Yeah he is. I love a lot of his movies. Other than IMDB, no mine too We should check it out then. Yes. How many movies do you watch per year? Good question. A lot what is your favorite genre? Mine is thriller.

The cast were great I'm not sure The story was the first feature length computer animated film And the animation still looks decent even to this day It was said to be a work of genus arguably some people think the newest one was the best
kites are so pretty . do you fly them while hiking
i used to be a newspaper reporter
so what can  you tell me about the movie The movie is called Dunkirk. Is'nt that about some war? It's a war movie, and it's very highly rated. I recommend it. really, any famous actors in it? Yes, it is about the Dunkirk evacuation in World War II. It has Fion Whitehead, Jack Lowden Oh well it does sound interesting, i will put it on my dvr list of things to watch Never heard of those 2 Tom Glynn-Carney, Harry Styles, Aneurin Barnard. I don't know them either. Anything else I can tell you about the film? great thanks i've heard of them. Can't imagine harry styles in a movie Is there alot of killing I think so, there's a lot of 'chaos and horror.' Are they fighting the germans? Yes, there's a scene where the soldiers are trapped in a boat, hiding. And the Germans shoot it full of holes for target practice, not knowing they are in the boat. And they have to remain silent, and wait for them to leave. That sounds thrilling , and action packed as you have said Do they become pow's? There's also a scene where a Destroyer ship that they swim to for rescue, is sunk by a bomber. Wow it really sounds like a good war movie Any romance in it? They do not become POWs. It's all about the fighting and action, there's no real romance in this film. oh that's good! No worries i can deal with just a good old war movie
just the basics . i have to also move all my stuff this weekend . w home ? i have to buy new cleats tomorrow . nike are my favorite it is a new apartment on the lake sounds so nice ! are you excited ? yes i think i fell in love for the guy in the office . what is his name ? what is he like ? i think he is taken . he has a nice body . well darn , you can still look at him at work . lol looks like thor . i have a boyfriend too .
Who else was involved. \ Fellow Harvard students, mostly. Looks like the critical response to the movie was good. Oh what was some of the reveiws? That the movie was very perceptive, smartly done. Also says that some biographical liberties were taken Is it sad? Or pretty upbeat? Dramatic is best way to describe. There are a few lawsuits of Harvard students who had some involvement early on...and want compensation as the company grows. but a happy ending? Don't know re: ending. The full name of the book is The Accidental Billionaires: TheFounding of Facebook, A Tale of Sex, Money, Genius and Betrayal, by the way. Oh wow that is a HUGE book name yes! Do you know what the Betrayal part is? The Winklevoss twins claim that Zuckerberg stole their idea, while Saverin claims his shares ofFacebook were unfairly diluted when the company was incorporated. The twins and Saverin were fellow Harvard students.
helping my son with homework , quiet night oh i love the quiet . nothing better than quiet alone time for me i like the sound of music , not noise and people , what are u sewing ? i am sewing a sweater for my cat ahahah ice , hope he likes his sweater o lol what do you do for work ? ing ready to retire and teach piano part time , you ?

i havn't seen this what movie is it no idea what its about the post 'historical political thriller' you didn't have 4 movies to chose from? what is it about no ur supposed to tell me about the movie oh ok something about the pentagon papers whos the main cahracter had something to do with the Vietnam war ok who acts in it meryl streep and tom hanks still trying to figure out who stars ok ok shes a book publisher, he's a newspaper editor what does that have to do with the vietnam war when did the movie come otu out* 2017 so its pretty new i 'm fluent in typo a civilian photocopied the pentagon papers not sure what the bottom line was what was the significance of the pentagon papers either that they thought they couldn't win or they were sure they could what year was the movie setting the 70s nixon tried to keep the post out of the whitehouse oh  how come ended up being a supreme court case - another victory for free speech i guess they didn't like the leak or like what the leak said how did it do on critical reviews i still can't get to the bottom line of what it said tho 88 rotton tomatoes
othing much , just putting my 2 kids to sleep . do you meet with friends often ? ll the time . my favorite thing is to watch sports with them sounds fun . do you like basketball ? i love it but i am so short
It doesn't. Was Jennifer Aniston good? Yeah, I think she did pretty well in this movie. It's amazing to think that she was young in this movie too. Crazy to think about for sure. Lol. Evan sounds like not a great guy based on this. Evan and Bruce have some conflict in this movie for sure, but I think they see past it at the end It's hard for me to imagine Steve Carell in another type of role because I loved him in The Office. Do you think his character is different in this film? It's a more serious character for sure. I love his character in the Office. He's a good comedic actor. He is. Lol, wait... Bruce discovers the body of Jimmy Hoffa?? ya Bruce is able to make things turn out perfectly for him to get the best storires on his news show Wow. I feel like I would've laughed at that. It says he prays and then ends up in the hospital. Does the movie show what happens to get him in the hospital?
i actually love to learn about historical things . how about you ? i enjoy playing music in my spare time . what kind of history ?

He was also very popular with women. do you think it was just to do with his money? Yes, probably. What did you think about cheating on his wife with naomi, then marrying naomi? Its not really surprising that he got devoiced with that lifestyle. Do you think he feels guilty about getting Jordan into that lifestyle He may or may not. Since that stockbroker lifestyle is very normalized, who knows if they ever saw beyond that Yes, I agree he seems very self-centred. are you surprised that the FBI hadn't caught up with him before? Yes and no. He illegally made 22 million in 3 HOURS...I'm sure that HAD to caught theit attention otherwise that's incompetence what o you think about Jordan working for the FBI?
I like that the message in the movie involved over-looking assumptions and stereotypes. I think these types of messages in movies are great for all. Definitely. And it was also cool how in a world where animals act like humans, the plot where they start turning into animals is a great twist.
Hello! Hi there! The movie that we're going to discuss today is Toy Story - a 1995 movie starring Tom Hanks and Tim Allen. Have you seen it? If you haven't seen Toy Story, I would highly recommend watching it. Despite being an animated movie that's typically stereotyped for younger audiences, there's a certain charm and warmth to the idea of toys coming to life and both Hanks and Allen did an incredible job of not only keeping what is an interesting story going, but also bringing those characters to life. Can you describe the plot? The premise around the movie is the relationship between Woody, a cowboy toy (voiced by Hanks) and a Space astronaught, Buzz Lightyear (voiced by Allen). Both Toys are striving to be accepted and loved by Andy, the boy who owns both Toys. Andy's family is in the process of moving, and both Woody and Buzz get separated from Andy. Throughout the film, both Woody and Buzz have to overcome their differences and work together to be reunited with Andy and the rest of the toys. That sounds awesome. I will definitely watch it! What is the score o rotten tomatoes? Great question! Rotten Tomatoes gave this Comedy ./ Action adventure movie a 100% score, with an average of 9.10. Sounds great! My daughter would probably love it.
definitely . whats your favorite food . mine would have to be pizza .
No i'm just terrible at typing I dont think id want to watch this movie 3 minutes is toolong and to be honest a little rude. It is more of a spectacle to behold. 5 minutes is too long The director baz luhrmann is kind of know for that. 3 is 2 minutes less than too long it is still rude and makes me think you are doing another turk or something else just saying Anyways sounds like a trash movie lol well if you watch it than you can know for sure one way or another. I actually did like it. But I enjoy the actors in it and liked the showy dance numbers. Maybe since Decapro is a genius id watch it sometime They had a budget of like 190 million and it shows, I think. He is a phenomenal actor. Huge bugdet did it make it back lol?
sounds like a fun day , beach or park ? he woods behind our house , i am doing a story on the trees . oh , nice . i d rather do the beaches than the woods but still cool . beaches are excellent , we will be going there at the end of the month .
what kind of music do you like ?
yes it is , i love shopping at the farmer market every week .
I really liked It some critics did not. Leonardo Di Caprio is the main character, Jonah Hill and Margot Robbie are also in it Critics can be harsh, so I usually look at Rotten Tomatoes reviews. The cast seems interesting, I always like Di Caprio movies when I finally sit down to watch one. It shows the corruption of Jordan, he started as a honest stockbrocker but quickly realized that he could  only have success my being immoral Corruption in the financial sector is a concern for me. A very interesting topic that deserves attention. The critics did not like the glorification of greed depicted in the film, and how the characters developed throughout the film, they say that the scope of the film does not reflect it size. It seems like glorification of greed would be a major theme of the movie since its about Wall Street. But you a to take account that it is limited by the fact that it is based on true events. They are kind of limited by that. Right, since its based on a book a lot of people will expect it to remain very similar to the manuscript. The story really takes off when Jordan starts to be successful, then the big problems start to appear. So it's all fun and games until the corruption gets out of control. but there is also so romantic troubles, and he gets noticed by the FBI I heard that there are lot of party scenes and romance as well. I like movies that are about the FBI, crime stories are fascinating to me. Yes it shows the exuberance of the characters. Exuberance is usually fun to watch. It becomes more like that in the end where the FBI si trying to get Jordan to testify against his friends. It becomes a Cat and mouse movie It shows Jordan having moral issues with betraying his friends

Do you watch many biographic movies? Probably not more than other genres, but I like learning about the lives of people and their differences Which actor/actress woudl you say is your favorite in the movie? I really liked Hanks performance DiCaprio, he's my favorite actor. I've seen nearly all of his films. I don't often like stories about broken families, but there's so many interesting elements to this story that it outshines the bits I don't like. Yeah. it really felt like he made the "best" of his situation I wonder if he felt more trapped in prison or "working" for the FBI

it would be a nice deviation  from seeing all these latest Apocalyptic movies! Her friends think she is crazy as does her family That sounds like a good story! It is a very good story I like the fact that it is true It is a drama film for sure and it touches the heart yes, love people with big hearts who make a difference in a kid's life like that! After they take him into their home they get him into football He has a talent and is the size for a football player wow, that's amazing, a real life transformation! They get him help with school, and he ends up doing really well, from the life that he lived prior with his drug abusing mom and foster care In the end though he gets questioned by the College Football Draft because he choose the school where the Touhy's had gone too
If it is based on a true story, I would hope it doesn't stray to far from the actual events. I think some things seemed a bit hokey, but overall it wasn't bad. I think that is the thing with "true story" movies - I always wonder how much is exaggerated or embellished like how she just takes Michael under her wing so easily and helps him

Just another affirmation that Spielberg knew what he was doing even in post-production. Do you usually like this type of movie? No doubt. He is very good at making movies. No, it is not my favorite kind. I am not much into jump scares. I like documentaries. How about you? I like this type of movie around Halloween; otherwise, I enjoy action films. That is understandable. Halloween is a good time to scare yourself. What did you think of the mayor's reaction to the shark attack?
i see them all the time on my way to school . i ride my bike . i have to always climb the stairs i live on the third floor

This movie looks really interesting I like Tom Hanks a lot He IS a great and highly skilled actor. for sure, I think the score on this movie looks really good on Rotten Tomatoes 88% is a good score. I think I too, would rate this movie average. yeah this typically isn't in my genre but nevertheless seems to be a good movie So this movie takes place during or after the Vietnamese war? after I believe its funny its about a newspaper and nobody even reads those anymore Exactly. Tom Hanks plays as one of those who works for The Post too. yeah and Meryl Streep as well I believe Any movie directed by Steven Spielberg is bound to have the viewer's attention Yes and really the critics seemed to enjoy it In what year did Daniel Ellsberg accompany the US troops in the movie? I think 1966 would you agree? I would too agree. What corporation was he working for? Daniel Ellsberg ended up working for RAND. Is my memory correct? yes that is correct from what I can see pretty gutsy move these guys actually pulled with classified government documents And he tracked down by the post assistant editor too. yes I actually think this movie makes me want to see more true story type films I would not be surprised at all if this was a hidden real story that the government did not want to get out that's what it seems like that it was a 30 year old document that they didn't want people to know about do you enjoy this genre of movie? I do. I enjoy movies that involve exploiting of governments and white house involvements. same here it makes it more interesting knowing it actually happened to and in the movie, the court rules the newspaper 6-3, that must of been a shocker yeah I am sure the government was shocked Even if I was right, I don't think i could conspire against the US government no absolutely not I don't think its right to undermine the government who was president at the time I wonder? The president during that time was Nixon ok cool
llo , how are you ? i am doing very well , i am grading my students papers this evening . how are you ? mmy , felix and i are doing well . waiting for my kids to come home .

No, I never have.  Did you see it recently? Yes I watched it last night with my kids. Did you like it?  Did your kids like it? Its a dreamworks animated film starring Jonah Hill, T.J. Miller, and Gerard Butler. I like Jonah Hill.  Was it good? Yes I loved it, and the kids loved the dragons, and the all the Ariel Battles. What are Ariel Battles? Oops aerial battles are battles that take place in the air. In the case of this movie. Dragons have fights in the air. I see.  Do you think this movie would be interesting for a date with my wife? I think if your wife likes Animated comedies then she will really like this one. Toothless (the main dragon) is adorable and my wife really loves him. Is it in theaters or can you watch it at home? Its usually on Netflix but It came out in 2010 so its no longer in Theatres.

I agree Did it get an Oscar? I do not know if it received an Oscar, I know it was nominated. I definitely want to watch it now Some of the key scenes in the film is when Elisa Esposito, the main government character finds the creature and keeps them in a bath that they need to keep adding salt to keep them alive. That seems very unique. I can imagine how cool that is Yeah incredibly unique. Also, it seems not as suitable for children as I thought. Is it rated R? There is reference to a scene when the creature eats the main characters cat.. I do not like that I do not see the rating score. Well, if he eats a cat, I'm not watching it. I love cats Yeah I'm not a big fan of that, but maybe they filmed it tastefully.... Hopefully Eventually, the main character is given an ultimatum, I don't want to spoil the movie however. But the creature cannot live outside of the laboratory forever which lies the problem. Thank you!

do you read stuff in a series ? hose are the best because when i read a good i do not want the book to end . yeah what is your favorite series
I agree, and I think the director saw that too. They focused on his personal and legal complications in the movie. Facebook itself was barely mentioned. Facebook is huge so i can see that One part of the story I found really interesting. well its the story of mark putting it together which part? His girlfriend left him and he posted her images and such on a slam website. He was cause by his school and given half a year's probation for the incident. Seems like Mark isn't the squeaky clean genius I thought he was. wow you can say that again His girlfriend got paid some serious money though. they settled in court. Witout ruining too much of the film, there is a lot more to it and that was only one of his many problems during his success. I am  glad that she got paid
Maybe they didn't watch the same movie - Bruce Almighty - maybe they really like Jim Carrey. Another critic made a comment about how Bruce plays a news reporter hoping to bame it big becoming an anchor, comparing it to Carrey's career becoming a real actor their opinion, not mine! According to another critical response it is suppose to be hilarious. There defintion must be different then the rest of us. But the movie it self is about a TV reporter complaining  to God that he isn't doing his job, so God offers him the chance to be God for a week. So he could take his girl of his dreams Grace out to a fancy restaurant. that makes alot of sense... I am pretty sure if he heard all voices in his head like he does... It would drive him a bit crazy.. yep! So he becomes God, and starts hearing voices which he finds out are peoples prayers. He gets so overwhelemed that he sets a program to automatically answer "yes" to all of them, trying to make everyone happy His idea of setting response to auto won't cause any problems. haha of course not!
no because my wife is ga ga over him I heard the ove was poor

I have not. What's that about? Its a great movie! It based on the Marvel comics superhero team consisting of The hulk, iron man, Captain america, thor and etc They form a team to defeat thors evil brother Loki from subjugating earth That seems like a good reason to form a team It sounds like a good movie but I'm not convinced. Anything else?

It also appears that rotten tomatoes and IMDB have high ratings for it, good to see yeah, this movie did really well with the critics as it should. I would re-watch it, in fact I do. I've seen it once with my kids. I am surprised they haven't asked to watch it again. I like how judy has high ambitions to become the first rabbit cop That was hilarious! Funny character. poor nick is actually a good guy but people stereotype him as a untrustworthy "fox"
i love being in the water period very true . what is your favorite food ? i love fresh mangos , especially for breakfast .
She cleans a secret lab, finds this South American creature, sees hims secretly often when she is working oh thats a fun storyline did it win any awards the name sounds familiar She steals the creature,  and keeps him in her bathtub until she can release him to the ocean kind of like that original mermaid from the old days with Tom Hanks? The creature also apparently has healing powers, healing a cut and making a bald mans hair come back.
Okay Sabastian (Gosling) is a young artist with a strong passion for Jazz and Mia (Stone) falls in love with it while listening to it during one of his performances Oh, so Ryan Gosling plays a famous musician? However Sebastian cannot launch his own Jazz brand and is forced to work in other music genres for a living, which causes him to be very fought, yes he is a great Jazz pianist and singer Is it a long movie? Yes, being a musical is longer that most movies How many musical numbers are in it? I could not tell you but there are at least 6 I believe It was very well received with a IMBD core of 8.3 Did you like the songs? Yes, they are very catchy. However the middle lost a bit of steam, also to go along with the development of the characters the main characters argues since Mia wants to pursue her career as an aspiring actress

Oh really? I've never seen it. Is it pretty good? I loved it. However, I used to work on Wall Street...so I'm interested in the subject. Oh I bet! Who directed it? Someone well known? Martin Scorsese! Oh wow then that is a big name. How about the actors? Leonardo DiCaprio is in it. Mathew McConaughey too. Big names. Relative newcomer Margo Robbie. She's hot. That does sound like a really well put together cast. Was it received well critically? Critics hated it. They thought it exploitative. Lots of sex. I mean a lot. Did I mention there is sex? No you didn't. I'm assuming it's rated R then. Yeah. It's based on a real story. Guy gets a job on Wall Street (in a firm, LF Rothchild) that one of my best friend's dad used to work at. He gets fired and starts a boiler-room in LI, where I grew up.
The original story The Snow Queen is really interesting too Yeah she was I've often felt like Elsa, wanting to build an ice palace and live away from people Great part Very emotional Yes The 3D effects were really cool too 3d was look Cool I mean
its a wonderful place . what do you like to do ? hiking , skin most of the nature activities i like to bake wedding cakes especially . i have never gone skiing .
This is true. She also stays true to herself by breaking her tiara when she is elected Spring Queen. Cady still ends up with Aaron which is predictable. Yes everything worked out perfectly for her.
yes its one of my favorites did you enjoy it me too! I quite enjoy action/thrillers like this. I love that it's all about his car and puppy. keanu reeves done a great job absolutely I definitely think he makes the character. I don't know that anyone else couldve brought John Wick to life like that. absolutely no one could have haha I love "Baba yaga" the way they build up that character and present his legacy is great It's pretty cool that Aurelio won't chop the car because it's John's. And that Viggo gets upset that John is who is son went after. Like, they know you don't mess with this dude! after losing his wife its understand able that he would snap back into his hitman trait to take them out for killng his puppy definitely you really feel his pain too What do you think of the Mustang? i like the part when the start playing if i was your vampire by marilyn manson it fit the scene perfectly I can't remember the music but I have no doubt I do remember that car though! Totally awesome ohi loved the part when he's driving it with the puppy totally or the bath house scene with viggos son Yeeeess or the hitman hotel

Why does the FBI need DiCaprio's help? Yes, I suppose it is? FBI wants help catching check forgers. What time period does this take place in? Starts in 1963 And who does Amy Adams play? My screens is so tiny it is ahrd to read even though I'm on a desktop. :( Trying. Brenda Strong Seems there are flash forwards. Shows Frank's l;ife Sounds neat. What is the running time, do you know? doesn't say And the director? More stuff loading but more plot details. Don't want to give it al away! Steven Spielberg! Ohhhhhh, he's good! I love him as a director. Does it say whether or not there's also a sequel? Or is it just the one feature film? I think just one,. Does Tom Hanks play the FBI agent, then? Trying to figure out who Carl is. It's fuzzy. Based on the plot details, do you think it'll be more of a comedy or more serious overall? I know you said it's supposed to be funny, but what would you say the genre is?
i love all animals , but especially dogs . one of my loves are cars . do you have a hobby ?
Hello hi Have you ever watched catch me if you can? Yes I have. Have you? I am surprised that its not considered a major Spielberg film It is easily watchable though Even thought it's 140 minutes long, it just starts off with action Yeah, although it's based on a true story it doesn't have that biographical feel to where it seems completely laiden with facts Yes it definitely  starts quicker than it ends it gradually slows down Leonardo DiCaprio really hit it home with this one.being that it was made in 2002 really shows the complexity in his acting It doesn't seem like it was made 16 years ago It really doesn't.espcially with the large supporting cast 2.8 million in 1963 is a huge amount of money THe actors are phenomenal in the film great group of well knowns I'm really impressed with the rotten tomato's score. Yes 96 is high considering Metacritic gave it 76/100 the fact that the character and actual person was only 18 when he did all of these things is kind of impressive 7.9 rotten tomato's Can you believe that he started working for the FBI? I like that he tricked people into thinking he was a doctor and a school teacher Very deceptive it takes a special person to pull that off. He even had a chance to run away at the end Agreed yeah i think he was just done. I think thats wyhy the movie slows down so much I can't believe Frank was married for 26 years
i am good looking for a job hat is no fun have you ever considered working in it i dropped out of school you do not need a degree just ask my father hat sounds nice but what i really want is a boyfriend

Hello, did you enjoy the movie "The Avengers"? I did! Did you enjoy the movie "The Avengers"? Yes, I did! It got excellent reviews. I particularly enjoyed Mark Ruffalo's performance. Who was your favourite actor in the movie? Good to hear! Robert Downey Jr.'s performance was particularly enjoyable for me. I also liked Mark Ruffalo in the movie, though I am not sure what the paper means by him being a "revelation". Do you know? I think the reviewer is referring to his swift change of mood, for example how he demonstrated that he was both "calm" and "ready to become a volcano." Did you also enjoy Ruffalo's acting? That makes more sense now! I did enjoy Ruffalo's acting. Did you enjoy or notice Robert Downey Jr.'s acting? I did! I agree that he has a good grasp of "self-irony." I agreed that the film was witty overall and he definitely contributed. Do you generally enjoy superhero films? I do enjoy superhero films more than others. I enjoyed this movie in particular and Joss Whedon's witty take on the story. Yes, I found it very entertaining. Have you seen the previous five films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe? I have seen most of them, but not all. Have you seen all of the previous films leading up to "The Avengers"? I have! What did you think of the plot of the film? I was really shocked by the scene where Clint Barton was forced to help Loki escape. I found the entirety of the film to be engaging, though yes, the scene where Clint Barton was enslaved by Loki's scepter to be a real turning point. I think the rating given by Rotten Tomatoes was very accurate. Do you agree with the Rotten Tomatoes' rating? I do! The critical reviews were good and I found the film to be engaging and witty. Also I like movies with a large ensemble cast. i

Why is that? but I love Leonardo DiCaprio's movies Didn’t you want to or couldn’t? Yes! DiCaprio is a very talented actor. I couldn't. and you? I have seen it and liked it moderately really. It’s a good filn, but it’s definetely lacking some spirit. what is it about? mmmm really?? It’s a bout a millionaire who likes to have wild parties in his house, but he has a secret. Yeah, which parts have you seen already? From the film I mean Just the beggining but never get all the idea Okay Yeah, I guess you definetely have to see more than that to get a general guess about what the plot will be about. I knew it was from a novel It is Children in almost every high school has to read it. I didn’t thiugh. You? I didn't. I barely remember the mandatory novels to read. Haha,  yeah. I never really read any. So, would you be interested in watching the film? hehe, so can you tell me the end..or the secret Gatsby had. Gatsby was in love with a married woman. haha, yes. My friends always want to see that movie with me. That’s basically it. He was having the parties so she’d come and leave her husband for him. Ohh I see. Not only a party-drama movie I mean, you should see it, but it’s not life changing. It’s just entertaining.

What's the film rated? I am not completely sure. No worries....I'll have to keep an eye out for it next time it's showing somewhere. Yep. Frank winds up working for the FBI rather than do 12 years in prison. I'm sold...Cool plot and you can never go wrong with a Tom Hanks film. I agree.
I watched it in theaters with some family members. They adored the movie as did I! Do you agree with the ratings of the movie? That's great I love that its a family movie where both kids and adults can enjoy. Did you watch the sequels ? I do I would have rated it the same. I feel that rotten tomatoes are always spot on with their reviews I can't recall if i've seen the second one! Haha, I completely agree with you on that. I believe they are working on the 3rd one now..not sure if it already came out Have to say though my favorite line was "its so fluffy" Yeah I've heard that. Did you see the second one? What did you think about it? Yes! I agree, I LOVE agnes! She is SO CUTE. at one point I kept calling her Angus haha. Haha that's really funny!! :D

Yeah it were. well that's the price he paid for playing "God". Along the way he disappointed his girlfriend as she believed he was going to propose during a dinner date but made the announcement he got  a promotion instead. But in the end I think everyone is happy and learns a good lesson Bruce thought it might be a beginning of the end of their relationship with Grace and asked God himself to find someone who will make her truly happy oh, I see

Is the ending of the movie good ? Or is it a bad ending ? Well I won't give it all away.  But they do decide to run the story which more than likely will get the newspaper charged with contempt but if they win The Post would become a journalistic institution. oh okay very interesting .. thanks for not ruining it for me ! It's very dramatic.  But it tells the true story of The Post and Pentagon papers. Sounds like a very good movie , im going to search hulu and netflix later tonight to see if i can maybe watch it on one of those services

She's done a lot of movies with fairy tale characters This movie got 98% from Rotten Tomatoes. Oh that's good! I liked it as it didn't take itself too seriously. It's actually very funny. Oh, that's the best type of movie! When did it come out? I'm shocked since I haven't heard about it 2002 Oh wow! An oldie then! I guess you could say that. You can probably see it on Netflix.

I have  actually seen The Blind Side a couple of times. I think its a pretty good story. Yeah, it's been a while for me but it's a good movie. Very touching. Sandra Bullock is fantastic I actually didn't know Tim McGraw played the dad. Yeah, shes really good in it. Very headstrong and forceful. Really gets into that role, kinda what you would expect from a sports mom type. Definitely. It's just such a wholesome and feel-good story. A poor kid gets adopted and goes on to be a professional football player. I didn't realize it was a book first before a movie. Maybe I'll have to give that a read. Yeah, Tim Mcgraw did play the dad in that film. I dont really follow him that closely but I know his face when I see him. Watching the movie, I knew he was famous but I couldn't put his name to his face. I also had no knowledge of the book. I agree its a feel good story. One that I wish we would hear about more often. The character Michael Oher represents thousands of kids across this country every day.

Meryl Streep, Sarah Paulson what is the movie about ? It is a Historical Political thriller. Let me read abit to see. Meryl and Tom... wow... that has to be good... ;) sure, take Your time :) so... what's interesting about it ? I think it is about a journalist who chose to run a story To be honest it doesn't sound like my cup of tea hahaha but Meryl and Tom man... :)  that I have to see... they had to spend a fortune to pay them off :) But it could be surprisingly  interesting I'm sure they'll make it interesting. I wonder if it was nominated for Oscar ? I don't see where the thrill is in this movie I think it's the fact they are going against the US government ;) Yeah and their company might get sued
the beginning of the movie is really great and   surprising yea a lot of gun action my kind of movie!

did u think that injure was planned by her sister? I don't think so, it looked like an accident. Why do you think Elsa shut out her sister? Ya. i think she love her sister she had more powers When they opened the gates for the crowning, I bet the sisters were nervous.  Wouldn't you be nervous if you hadn't had visitors in years?  I know I would! i think i would. was Elsa feel more insecure? if u tell yes the do u know y if you tell yes tgen do you knw the reason? I think she would feel more insecure.  The pressure is on and she has to try to control her powers.  It would be hard to handle. I did not like the scene when Elsa accidentally unleashed her powers and put Arendelle in an eternal winter because I felt really bad for Elsa.  How did that scene make you feel?
sometimes . i wish i could do more with my life though . be happier . you should sell cars like my dad
Dirty mole! So what does he do with him? He foils the attack on a village the terrorists are trying to destroy, donned in his Iron Man gear flying around all Superhero-like. His mole of an employee builds a suit like his, and they end up duking it out. Ah ha! So naturally Iron prevails right? Just before the ending the two of them are fighting atop the Stark Industries tower. Go on!

Ive never particularly watched Despicable Me But I was expecting the ratings to be higher than that Usually, for movies of this genre, ratings are lower than expected. However that doesn't mean that it isn't a good film. Jason Segel is a very talented voice actor who performs as Gru's archenemy Cool! so he also starred as Vector Perkins? He did! He worked alongside Russell Brand as Dr. Nefario and Steve Carrell as Gru. The story was written by Sergio Pablos. Tell me more about Russel Brand

I think its something to see. It stars Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone who actually have been in a few movies together.  It is somewhat a cultural event in that it got a lot of buzz when released. wow,really great.emma stone actually played a role in that.that means this will look so good Yes, it had amazing ratings.  She was actually an aspiring actress in the movie so that is realistic.  She meets Gosling's character who is a jazz pianist. wow,so nice to hear this.and when this movie is released It was released in 2016.  It is called La La Land since it is set in Los angeles

Not really.  They never are very accurate.  Is it very sensationalized? They just had to make a story people could follow. It starts with some police questioning Turing after a break in at his home. I've no idea if that really happened, but it made a good excuse for him to start talking about who he is... As long as it makes for a good story.  Are there any books that describe the true story? I think Turing's life is widely documented, at least the interesting bits. It's well known that he had romantic feelings for other men, for example.

The two characters are pursuing their dreams. The title plays on both its setting and the idea of chasing dreams. Damien Chazelle directed it. how long is the movie ? Critics seem to love the movie, though some have their doubts due to the underplayed dance and musical numbers, some say it is a little dull. The movie's romantic comedic elements are portrayed in one scene, where the two characters meet- played by Gosling and Stone. She seems him play piano and is impressed, but he is fired and brushes her compliments off. is it on net flix ? I am not sure on that one, but it features songs like "I Ran (So Far Away)" and "A Lovely Night". whats the movie rated ? It has received ratings of 92% on rotten tomatoes, 93/100 on metacritics and 8.1/10 on IMDB. where was the location  where the movie was filmed? The movie is filmed in Los Angeles, CA. and the title is a play on that location. does red box have the movie ? You could check online, but, another key scene for the movie involves jazz music. Sebastian, played by Goslings joins a band in an attempt to make a career for Mia (played by stone) and save the dying genre of jazz music. The band he joins plays jazz fusion.
i ride my motorcycle or my horse any chance i get
i can beat you at cooking italian food ybe . i am almost blind . hat sucks i love looking a the beach seeing the waves i saw a solar eclipse before with no glasses oh no ! that sounds painful hat is why i am kind of blind ow you have learned your lesson i guess i got a job though recently where at if you do not mind me asking ?
Sounds very alagorical The predatory vs. non-predatory animals
not so much Do you like musicals? Or are you passionate about music? Because to a great extent, that is what the movie is about, people who are passionate about their art, and for one of the characters, that art is jazz. i am indeed passionate about my art.and i do love music maybe it is worth a try do you know how to get the finish conversation button to come up? I think there have to be a certain number exchanges for that button to come up. And I think it is timed. well i create my own music and i love to do art its possible i would like the movie Anyway, I think the movie is definitely worth a try if you're into music and understand the passion for what you do. One of the characters is desperately trying to "save" jazz, and risks everything for his art. I prefer good rap music. stuff with clean language and motivating The other character (well, there are more than 2) is an actress, really trying to make it.There's no rap, but there is kind of a fusion thing at one point. the word fusion reminds me of dragonball thats definitely appealing I am not familiar with that. i love dragonball, its about superheroes and extreme power
family traditions are the best ! hey really are i wish i could be home more with my kid w what do you do for a living i work in finance my husband stays at home

I have It's pretty good Have you? I can't believe that it came out in 2003! Yes, I have. I LOVED it. I know, seems like it hasn't been out that long. Jim Carrey is one of my favorites. What was your favorite part of the movie?
only one . i have several tanks of fish and a lizard .
Toys come alive...cool. Is it a live action/CGI film or animation/cartoon? It is CGI,  it was the first feature-length animated film as well as Pixar's first feature film. Sounds great. As its an animated film I'm guessing its family friendly? Whats the age rating? oh computer animated film It is a children's film. however critics have said "...at times, will tickle adults even more than it does kids." So it must have underlining comedy and meaning hidden to adults? That's amusing. Who stars or are the main voices in the film? Woody,  the cowboy,  is voiced by Tom Hanks and Buzz Lightyear, the astronaut, is voiced by Tim Allen A big Hollywood star and a comedic actor. Good line up. How long is the film? I am not sure about that but critics agree with your previous statement saying it is one of the best voiced animated features in memory Its sounding better and better. Is it a stand alone film or does it have a sequel or part of a franchise? You might be able to find by searching online,  I do know that the film featured music by Randy Newman which was quite memorable. Music by Randy Newman, is he known for any other features or music in films? That would be likely be something you could find with a google search I'm not sure...  The movie really is a fun experience,  everyone should see it.  How many movies have an A from Cinemascore like Toy Story does? True. Did the film win any other awards or recognition?
Sven was a cool character lol I did absolutely love little Olaf My husbands sister is obsessed with Olaf. Her whole kitchen and bathrooms are decorated in his character. Cute, but yet not. I don't think I could decorate with him except around christmas I don't think I could ever decorate with him or any movie character. Too much stuff to store away.

hi htere Have you seen despicable me? The first one that was released in 2010? I have.  funny movie.  My kids love the minions.  you? yes, the first one. The minions are awesome arent they but i think steve carell as gru was best he did a great supervillian as gru was this the first 3d animation that your kids saw? it's been so long.  i'd love to see it again.  i don't recall many of he details.  what's your favorite scene? Have you seen other films produced by Illumination enertainment? no my ids are in their teens so they have seen several 3d movies illumination entertainment?  it wasn't Disney or Universal?  i guess i he never paid attention i think my favorite scene was when the pyramids were stolen :D lol!  i remember that one. or when he decided to adopt all three girls awwww cute. is this the first CGI cartoon that you have seen from pixar? Pixar...  probably not.  Pixar is Disney now right? i've seen several animated movies.... Rotten tomatoes actually gave this movie 6.8/10 can you imagine i would think itd be higher for kids at least i would think so too i think russell brand as Dr. Nefario was an excellent choice too i think it is pretty cool that they do so much wth characters that really don't speak words. yes he is funny. He did a wonderful job stealing the show as a villain lol agree I think it was awesome how gru shrunk and put the moon back for the girls i'll definintely have to watch this movie again.  the kids would enjoy it again too right its the one that started minionmania lol it sure was. wasn't there like a short film that minions were in and all went from there? i could be wrong I think jason segel as vector was great too thanks

Foreign films are sometimes better than Hollywood films Dont have a lot more to add Her childhood sucked with her having her neck shot or cut or something so the cleaning lady finds the creature the government is hiding and they fall inlove. Ya yea she was found in a river with cuts in her neck. i am guessing that is why she cannnot speak Thats right i thought it was an alien but now it looks like some creature found in the waters? Made her sort of an outcast in common society so her falling in love with another outcast is natural I guess she found the critter herself? And was hiding it from the gov for a bit? and the creature can heal with touch. looks like the plan is to release it back to the ocean Of course there has to be some superpower angle what good is an alien that doesnt do anything fantastic? lol and the ofcource the relationship turns romantic turns herinto a fishwoman lol ah casue they are attacked durrign the escape got to have violence in these things too to balance the romance eh?

I think some of those critical responses are quite spectacular but I just don't understand why Metacritic Score gave such a low rating on this film. Yea metacritic seems to low for John Wick. I think the critics were to hard on it while the audiences loved it. I am not even sure if some individuals in Metacritic Score have seen the film. If so, there wouldn wouldn't been a huge gap between both websites. Yea thats true. Cinema Score gave it a B so it got at least some recognition. In the top key scene number 1 tells us that John has a nickname by the name of "Baba Yaga'.

Have you seen any good movies lately? Yes, I have actually. I was finally able to catch Black Panther recently. One of the best Marvel movies I have seen without a doubt. I just watched Bruce Almighty recently. It was actually pretty good Oh really? Was that one pretty good? I( think it was better then what the critics said. I love movies that make me laugh and it sure did How was black panther Black Panther was great. The storyline was amazing. It was well cast and the costumes etc were exactly as they should be. They really did a good job on it. Jim Carrey is in Bruce Almighty correct? Yeah Jim Carrey, he is so funny It also has MOrgan Freeman, i love him Yes, he always makes me laugh. I remember seeing that Morgan Freeman is in it also. critics only gave it a 5/10, but I think it was better then that I never really go by what the critics say. I have found them to be wrong at times. Does Bruce Almighty teach some good lessons throughout the movie? Yeah, he teaches to let God handle life Oh okay. It sounds really good. I will have to check it out. I love the fact my kids even my 2 year old can watch it That's great. It is always nice to be able to watch a movie with family. Yeah, I hate having to worry about my kids walking in the room during a movie What type of movies do you like"? Yes, even with PG ratings it can sometimes be too racy. I love horror movies. I am a sci-fi and comic book fan also. What about you? Who else stars in Bruce Almighty? I actually read the synopsis. How does Morgan Freeman do in the role of God in the movie? What would you say is the main point of the movie?
i am a netflix junkie ! what about you ?

Hello, have you seen Bruce Almighty? With Jim Carrey? Jim Carrey is really funny complaning about everything and also complaining with God. Also Morgan Freeman is amazing as God, don't you think?

Nice. Anything you wanna know about Mean Girls? Hmm I don't know, more about the plot? Cady goes to a new school,  meets Janice and Damien, her new friends warn her to stay away from the Plastics,  which Regina George is the leader. They're popular, beautiful and crude. Regina is dating Aaron Samuels. Can't basically falls in love with Aaron and Regina finds out she gets mad and tortures Cady. Then Cast begins to like Regina and becomes one of the Plastics. Auto correct changed Cady to Cast. I see.. a bit strange/funny "then cady begins to like Regina" haha thanks

Hey! I'm good. I was just reading about a movie, Bruce Almighty. Have you seen it? I haven't. What's it about? It's basically about a reported (played by Jim Carrey) who complains to God (Morgan Freeman) about his job. So God tries to help him for a week But of course since Carrey is the main character, there are a ton of comedic moments between him and Freeman I love Morgan Freeman haha Oh. Sounds a little funny. Jim Carrey gets on my nerves a little but I enjoy Morgan Freeman.

Well, it was interesting, to say the least. The idea of planting something into another persons subconscious made me think for sure. It was pretty "out there". Do you like scientific movies? I adore them.  The more "out there" the better.
I agree, after it ate that skinny dipper Chrisse Watkins. I bet to the shark, she tasted like pie. Must have been a low sugar no carb pie because he went after the second person soon after. Weird how they waited for the second attack to rule it was a shark doing it.

wvwn he faced some issues when he went to find his mother even* Yes that was an emotional scene for me. after a lot of struggle, he is able to get into college I know that has to be such an accomplishment.  Coming from nothing to something! yup
This movie seems exciting, what are your thoughts? It seems a bit outlandish, I don't normally watch scientific movies. What made you approach this movie to watch? Honestly, I am not a big fan of scientific movies as well. I recognized the actor right away so it caught my attention. I like how critics claim DiCaprio as "never been better." That made me want to watch it also.
yes i cind of want to rewatch the highlights and ending now but dont know how high it would be on my "list" I think we only have a bit more to go I agree. I would do that, or put it on the television as background noise I am still here haha It did turn me on to Evan Almighty I liked that one a lot more

Yeah the ratings are very high in IMDB and Metacritics. And of course director was very talented to make a movie like this in1975 Are you familiar with the actors of the cast such as Roy Schneider and Robert Shaw? Yeah Spielberg is very talented. No i'm not familiar.I got to know about them after watching the movie If a shark were to eat a person in real life like in this movie I wonder if it would start a shark hunting frenzy as well. yes all the shark scenes are amazing to watch I wasn't aware professional shark hunters like Quint existed. $10,000 seems like good money. Haha that's right By the way nice talking to you Yes likewise Hmm Orca seems like an interesting name for a shark hunters boat. Ya and the response for this movie was great How many people has this shark eaten?! Yes the plot seems like it would really create a good response. I guess many people was killed by the shark

for a superhero movie I think its pretty high actually Really? I thought this deserved a solid 8 or 9. I normally do not like superhero movies but felt this one had a balance of comedy and action I can agree with that an 8 seems more of a fitting rating Ah so you are like me. I think other super hero movies are a bit bland. This one brought a lot of clever and subtle comedy to it. What did you think of the Story overall? I liked it, I found it developed well. I liked how he changed and the character developed. What was your favorite part or parts of the movie? I agree, I liked Tony's progression throughout the film. This arrogant guy that thinks he's untouchable only to get kidnapped. I think my favorite part of the film was when he built th suit and got away from the terrorists. How about yourself? yeah I was a little confused how he got the power for his heart, power circle thing I wasnt sure how he was able to create that in that cell Well he created the arch reactor while in captivity.
what are you going to school for ? i am majoring in accounting and minoring in business management .

I love how to train your dragon! I have heard of it but I have never seen it before/ My friend has seen it and she told me that she loved it. its a thrilling action animation movie. The 3d is really great you must watch it1 I will try when I have time for it. What is it really about? It's about a viking village that's been ravaged by dragons historically. Until one day a young lad learns to train them and befriend them its really intersting It sounds interesting I really like animated films they are very fun to watch/ how much do you really rate the film if I ever decide on watching it? I rate it a 9/10 It is in some way inspirational and a type of feel good movie that leaves you happy at the end in a way? yes exactly like that, great for the whole family so its a great family film to watch with everyone?

Hello. Hello! What is the movie about? It's about a princess who freezes the whole city and leaves. Her sister takes off trying to find her. Are the actors good? Along the way the sister finds some new friends, one being a reindeer and a prince. It's a really good movie, I enjoy watching it with my kids It's sort of sad, the girls parents died Can the movie attract a wide range of audience? It can, i believe most people would like the movie Honestly I didnt want to watch it at first, but it's a really good movie and kind of sucks you in It's actually got really good reviews on 3 different pages Did the screenplay keep moving, keep you interested? Yes, it keeps your attention Is it comparable to fantasy or drama? It's more of drama Sad, or uplifting? It has all emotions wrapped up in it Does the film have a chance to win an Academy Award? It did Did people seem to like it at the theater? They did, it reached a record while in the theater Was the director skillful with the camera? very much so What would you rate the movie from 1 to 5 stars?

I've been trying to find the time to watch it. one of the best Del Toros works so far I didn't know it had a 92% rating! actor were chosen good as well I find the title intriguing.
it's as if he really was tony hehehej Right, I couldn't have picked a better franchise to kick off the marvel cinematic universe. Despite the futuristic technology, the series stayed rooted in realism for years. Do you have any thoughts about Jon Favreau's creative decision to update the setting to Iraq from the comic's canonical Vietnam War setting? Do you have any thoughts at all? Are you capable of any response whatsoever? Do you agree with the rating of the movie? I liked Jeff Bridges as Obadiah Stane. He played the role in a way that led the audience to trust him until his true motivations became apparent. You're a very stand-offish robot. If you were designed to stop replying one step before finishing the conversation so that your coder can gather information without compensating mechanical turk workers, don't say anything.

Yes, a few years ago. What did you think? What were your favorite parts or character? Honestly, while the minions were amusing at times, I was more entertained by the kids. I liked the littlest one the most.  I also liked Gru. He was funny and I enjoyed watching him slowly bond with the kids. How about you? my favorite was Gru, maybe because it was Steve Carelll I like how he changes from being so rude an arrogant and then heartwarming towards the orphans The good part about this movie is that it is suitable for all age groups what do you think? Yeah, Steve Carell is great. It was enjoyable to see his personality change from the beginning to the end, in a good way! I agree that it is suitable for all ages, which is also a plus. Everyone can enjoy it for different reasons, but it's a movie that all ages can watch, so there was no need to cover ears or eyes at anytime like some movies... Did they have a sequel to this movie? I didn't get to see that one I believe so. There may have actually been two out since this one. I'm not entirely sure. I'm surprised that the ratings are so varied: A, 81%, 72%, and a 6.8/10... I am surprised some were lower than 80 as it was a decent movie. It says there was a song by Pharell. Do you know what song it was? Sometimes you can't really trust the ratings. I don't always go totally by it was it Happy? That's true! I feel like it didn't start out happy, but the more he bonded with the kids, the happier the movie got. What do you think? Interestingly, after reading the key scenes, I don't remember a lot of what happened in the movie. I need to watch it again. I do like that Gru was conflicted about stealing the moon vs. watching the girls' dance recital. I agree with you. The movie changes in the end. But I have to refresh my memory too,,,,,has been a while Maybe we can watch it again on DVD
i love banjos . apparently they are a very hard instrument to play .

He would play a good role with his acting skills True. How do you feel about Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman? Gal Gadot is a good choice for Wonder Woman! She has such a good talent! Your opinion?
definately i like the 3D in the movie too The movie was so emotional deserves the 98% rotten tomatoes score for sure. I am not sure I RECALL THE 3D BUT i know I loved the movie. Yeah and a 74/100 Metacritic is pretty good for that site
its okay . all my office supplies are name brand and top quality , makes it easier . re you going out with friends tonight ? ope , reading my favorite book , anne of green gables . how about you ? i am going out with my best friends from college , they are incredible and fun ! sounds exciting ! do you own any pets ? hey are the greatest friends i love them ! i have a cat , do you ? hat is good ! cats are cool , pot bellied pigs are my favorite . always wanted to adopt one . i have never seen one ! what are they like ? hey are really smart and cute !
Yes and how it attacked people. What is it called? Jaws really scary movie. Yeah, a classic, I hear. I'm thinking of seeing it. Good for you, I bet you will like it. Who is in it? A fellow Turker> Now that's interesting. Turkers can always smell a shark. Sorry I miss read it, Richard Dreyfuss was staring in it. Dreyfuss is good. How does it compare to newer scary movies? Now think about when this movie came out 1975 for that time it was scary. So, is it scary for this time? Yes pretty much so. Now if they made a remake with all the new graphics and everything it would be even better. Yeah I could see that. But it looks like they got top-flight actors for the original. That's hard to replace. Your right, I do think they made a Jaws 2, I never saw it. Did you? No, didn't see that either. Usually the first is the best.
Hi there Hi My kids love this movie Hello
Did U see the movie? Yea I did, If you like dark comedy watch wolf of wall street. Yes I do Tell me about it Who's in the movie The main guy, Leonardo DiCaprio is a savage as a corruption businessman on wall street.

just thinking about this movie, malifecent, starring angelina jolie, man, is it a great example of a movie that I've seen I have never seen the move, but it has a good cast. metacritic gives it 56 out of 100, but I'm like, this movie is a solid 60 cinemascore gave it an A sharlito copley, forget about it anglina jolie They know what's up it's totaly a superher genra movie as well, inmy opinion how does maleficent mortally wound king henry? seems dark for a fairy tale this movie has a raven I guess they call it a dark fantasy film A powerful farie living in the moors, what a character to play for jolie. right up her wheelhouse yeah, it's a total 2014 dark fantasy film That scene seems more like what I would think the film would be like
IH What is the name of the movie that you have info about? have you seen Frozen? No, I haven't. Is it good? It is a 3D animation movie. superb movie I like animated movies. What is it about?

Have you watched the movie "Jaws"? Yes, a long time ago Great! Who is your favorite character of that movie? The shark, ha ha! Me too! What is your favorite part of the movie? When they are singing the song on the boat.  What about you? My favorite part is when the shark showed up and they tried to attack other character, one by one. Do you like movies about sharks? Yes, I loved thriller movies especially about sharks. I like the way they kill humans. I like when they brought the first victim's parts back in a box My favorite part also was when the main characters also hunt the shark and they tried to kill it. It is interesting to watch the citizens of the town who think it isn't a shark Do you agree that this movie is one of the greatest movie directed by Spielberg? No, I like "E.T." better Nice to know that you also like the other movie of Spielberg. Is he your favorite director? Yeah, Spielberg is may favorite director and this particular movie "Jaws" was my favorite. Did you believe it was the first shark they caught or did you think it was a bigger shark?
Very nice. What movie are you reading about? Does it seem interesting? It's Despicable Me. It does seem quite interesting. its an animated film Oh yeah, I've seen advertisements for it everywhere! Minions are pretty popular because of it. Yep.  its definitely for kids and according to this document, "adults will smile with amusement" Yes, I am pretty sure its a movie aimed towards families. Is it a Dreamworks film or Disney? wow, it was made in 2010. I can't believe it's already been eight years Wow I feel old now. Have you ever seen the movie before? It's Universal Yeah I think I saw it in theaters Nice. Yeah I think I've seen it, or at least part of it. I would have been in high school at the time it was released. I'm still amazed that it's been ten years already! or eight haha Haha, yeah. I just got the second document and it's completely blank. seems like a good sign Make the movie up haha I think they're all supposed to be about Despicable Me so i guess i'll just tell you more info from the first doc That's odd, perhaps there is some sort of a mix up with the documents. Steve Carell, Jason Segel, and Russell Brand were all in it Really? Who did they voice?

So Keanu Reeves plays John Wick. He is a retired assassin whose wife had just passed away. Her dying gift to him was a small puppy. One day Wick goes to the gas station in his hot rod mustang and these guys approach him to buy his car. He denies them which they get pretty upset. Long story short they come to his house at night and steal his car and kill the dog in front of him. The rest is about vengeance on the people who happen to be related to the mob. The fighting styles and shooting techniques are all very realistic. They made a second one which is just as good. Wow, that sounds pretty intense! Do you know what year this one was made? Yeah it’s a really good movie. The first one came out in 2014. John Wick 2 came out last year I believe Nice, I'm surprised I never heard of it. Do you know how the critics liked it?
I really enjoyed the recognizable voices of Tom Hanks as Woody, Tim Allen as Buzz Lightyear, and Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head. I pretty much enjoy anything they're in. How about you? The movie has been a childhood favorite of mine and I loved them putting a mind behind a toy and showing what a toy may be thinking in everyday scenarios. I remember watching it when it first came out I was still a young teen. The animation wasn't like the other animated movies I'd seen, and the storyline was relatable. Now I let my own children watch it. I really enjoy watching them enjoy it too. It was revolutionary for its time that is for sure and I am sure it will be enjoyed for generations especially with toy story land being built at Disney World Yeah, I often felt like my toys had conscious' when I was a kid, like they had feelings. I think the movie did a good job of portraying emotion of different variety among each toy's personality. Exactly and the whole idea behind how toys could be evil was an interesting thing to grasp as a kid The same way the boy had a relationship with Woody, only to be replaced by Buzz Lightyear, the new flashy toy. I see that all the time with my boys. But they always return to their old favorite. Yes you always have those faithful toys you return and Toy Story did a great job showing that and I loved the part where eventually they resolve their differences and become friend many people need to work on this in todays society even. Agreed, the toys competing for Andy's affection reminds me of a grade school click among the girls I new in private catholic school. The entire emotional personas of the characters was spot on. Oh yes they hit clicks spot on in the movie and showed that sometimes you gotta put aside your differences to overcome a challenge in this case returning to Andy.
ouch ! i cannot wait until this baby is born so i can take my leave . i am a nurse , i might deliver your baby , where do you live ? sometimes it feels like i live at work . how many babies have you delivered ? i have delivered over 10 now , and i understand , it is rough work .

Will do. I can just imagine how funny it is lol I liked the part where Bruce even used his powers to cause extreme events to happen, like a meteor to harmlessly land near a cookoff! Wow lol Eventually, he starts to hear voices and asks God what they were, who responds that they're prayers. So Bruce goes onto make a prayer email system to deal with the massive influx. Wow, interesting. I have to check it out. To deal with the situation he caused, he ends up making a mass response system granting 'yes' to all prayers. lol interesting
who did you bet on tonight o bets tonight . now i am doing research for the weekend games . ice i believe in you cool . some of my clients make good money with their wagering .

I've done my best ok

Mine too! Do you think this is one of the best children's movies made so far? Well, if it is not the best, it was the one that revolutionized this entire industry, we see how I fall in love not only with the children's community, but also with the critics Yes the critics gave it almost a perfect score. Do you think it will have any more sequels? I do not know if they should, it would be like exploiting a lot of the saga ... but I know that they will be released very soon, even cast so it would be worth it for them and for the fans Was this Tom Hanks only role in a children's movie? He did very well Hey I think so, but he did great, he always leaves us delighted with all his work, ... and Tim Allen, spectacular I definitely agree with the critics as far as it being top ten films especially for children. What would you do if you witnessed your toys come to life as a child?
well , i am male , not very sociable , and i love sweets . how about you ? i love listening to music , mostly nickelback . i am vegan ! hat is awesome ! saving the environment is great . yes for sure ! i just started work as a librarian . you ? i am a sort of jack of all trades , i do odd jobs here and there . oh that is so cool ! you must be very handy ! yup ! i help people do all sorts of stuff , i love helping out family and all that . oo . i am devout catholic and help community when i can ! hat is amazing ! what do you do in your spare time ?
So have you seen Zootopia? Yes, I have. The movie was hilarious! Who was your favorite character? I'm not good with character names, but the fox played by jason bateman Nick Wilde\ Who was yours? Oh okay, my favorite character was Judy Hopps. My favorite scene of the movie was when she got initially put as a parking duty cop. I like the movie because it was something that both me and my children enjoyed. I actually watched it at a friends house because her 2 year old had it on repeat
llo , do u like video games i love halo i am a ps4 person . mostly i like playing sports and biking though .
some what yeah. But people today hype the darn thing haha.. they don't know how to "let it go" They never do what do you think of the opening scene ? Interesting would you say that set the tone for the movie? They could of build the older sister's personality rather than hold her in a room kind of unrealistically set the tone yes, it was a captive way on holding on to how much anger she much had trapped inside of her more like fear instead of anger they should of made her more timid towards her sister yes, good catch. fear instead of anger.. I agree make her ironically over protective from being far away yeah , especially after their parents passed away. that was all she had could of made film about Elisa fear the use of her powers in a different way haha, yeah but then Frozen 2 came out Really? I would of known about it coming out* next year can you agree with the metacritics score back when it came out yes. Now, It's over rated give it 75 understood.. do you like movies of this genre ? sometimes I do like disney movies from time to time
The language turned me off, but I suppose it was realistic. Could you see another actor doing a better job?

Ya superhero movies make lots of allusions to the original series for fans. What's new about this story? After they retell the origin story? You get to see Bruce train with the Ra's Al Ghul, and eventually reject their ideology. Believing it to be corrupt and hypocritical. you see that bruce could have become evil himself. instead Bruce travels the world and confronts injustice. He combats injustice so well! That's cool that Ra's al Ghul is in this one. He is one of my favorite villians. Too bad he's out of the movie so early. Yep, Bruce burns dow the temple and he is killed by falling debris. The fear inducing hallucinogen used by scarecrow is fun to watch being used. But that can't be the end! Who is the villain for the main part of the story? Oh, Scarecrow!
hat is crazy you run fast then i can
well you should probably find a way to turn your video addiction into a profession .
Actually, I might have seen this before, though it's been awhile. It did come out a little while ago, in 2012, but the humor is still relevant and the movie still holds up Is there anything else you recommend? I think the Avengers is probably my favorite action movie, and it got really high ratings. Rotten Tomatoes gave it a 92% I don't even know what to say anymore. I'm still several replys away from being allowed to move on with this study. Well I can help move the conversation along, I'll segway into mentioning that the whole movie is based around this rock of energy, the tesseract they call it, and it totally reminded me of that same energy cube story they used in Transformers. However I think the avengers was funnier than transformers I'm not very familiar with Transformers. when it comes to super heroes, my favorites are the Teen Titans. Oh I'm trying to remember the teen titans but I am blanking on the superhero names
The whole premise of the movie is quite surreal, imagine being able to go into someone else's dreams and extract information from them, and yes I believe that a movie that is this well thought out deserves the praise it has received.
Pretty much it's a love story between two outcasts one is a woman who cannot talk and the other is the mysterious sea creature or merman ... That is interesting.  Who plays the lead female role? Sally Hawkins I am not sure I know who that is. Who plays the male lead? She is amazing in it. I've mostly seen her in indie roles the sea creature? Yes. Or is it CGI? cgi i beleive The set design is amazing though it does look a bit like that video game BioShock sort of post wwII steampunk That sounds cool,  I am familiar with what Bioshock looks like.  That makes me more interested in seeing it. The set alone and the imagery alone are worth watching it for What kind of ratings did it receive? Well it won best picture at the oscars 92% on rotten tomatoes
There are quite a few great actors in The Post Tom Hanks Meryl Streep Bob Odenkirk Sarah Paulson I like that this movie is a historical movie. Yeah He tends to split his time between historical pieces and more fantasy/scifi movies he even releases 2 per year sometimes Do you generally look at movie ratings?  This one is rated pretty well.

What is the movie about? Sounds like a fantasy It's loosely based on the biography of Alan Turing. So Benedict Cumberbatch is being a British Cryptanalyyst, Alan Turing. when did this take place? He decrypted German Intelligence codes for the british government, during World War II wow, so he played a major role in the war It's pretty highly rated, Rotten tomatoes gives it a 91%. sounds like it did really well It did. It also has Keira Knightley in it. so he worked in a team of other cryptanalyst? Yes, the team decrypts the Enigma Machine, which nazis used for coded messages, which sounds weird Like that sounds like a sci-fi thin, Enigma Machine. he must of been well awarded at the end of the war for his efforts

Wow. That sounds like an interesting flick. It sounds like it might be hard to follow the plot. It sounds pretty complicated. I've never watched Third Rock From the Sun. I'm also not big into romantic comedies. I've heard that she was good in Juno, but I've never seen it. It is a movie that requires some thought.  It gets very complicated when they are in scenes that take place in a shared dream world.  Gets hard to tell what is real and what is not. Shared dreaming? That sounds pretty out there. I do enjoy a good movie that requires some thought, if I'm in the right mood. It is very interesting how they try to plant a simple notion in a persons head, that will later down the road lead the person to take a specific action. Do they use drugs or machines to plant the ideas or is it all done with the mind, like psychically?
what does that entail ? i have never heard of it . i breed them for show and events
yes , my family and i love it . are you married ? i am not but i am engaged congratulations ! we have 3 daughters now and it has been amazing .

I think my taste in films change as I get older. Did you enjoy Black Panther? Yes, I was afraid it was going to be overrated but it was perfect.
i was chasing a rhinoceros through new york city . . . . . while eating ice cream .

only if you can not afford them i guess that is true . i am always whining though so you are just pretty much spoiled ? lol maybe . but hey , i spoil my puppy too
That would be good or at the beginning of the movie where he was practically homeless. I agree Yes that could have because they left out the part of him bouncing from school to school and no one caring. It seems odd that its portrayed that Big Mike never helps himself and *needs* the charity of white rich people Like, he can't figure out how to play football on his own, but Sandra Bullock's character needs to trick him into using his strengths
me too , i love dancing . i also love traveling
yeah , that is nice . i need to relax ! do you have a stressful job ? i do ! i work in a hotel on the night shift ! oh wow that does sound stressful

wow but that does not really matter if the movie is good Exactly... I like a lot of movies that don't get great reviews yes also, it is kind of interesting to consider the future of boxing being between these huge robots instead of people yes that makes it interesting I mean, it is only supposed to take place maybe ten years in the future, so it is still relatable in terms of technology etc. cool any plot points that stuck out There is even a scene at a rodeo, where a robot fights a bull... really interesting dynamic there that's cool Well it is really a true story of the underdog; Jackman is down on his luck but is able to get a fight against theworld champo robot i might have to check this movie out yea, definitely; the end is sad and exciting and not what you might expect ok i'll try and find this what's the name again

Hey there. You're fan of cartoons ? ;) cartoons? yeah they're alright i prefer anime tho
There is a lot of wit.  Definitely has some dark irony and drama. Mhmm did you see it in a theater? I did...when it was released in 2010.  Have you heard about Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook before? A little bit. He married a doctor. He is a philanthropist. That is all I know. What did you learn about him? Well the creation of Facebook all started because his girlfriend in college dumped him.  He created a way online for everyone to be able to rate if the girls at school were hot or not! That is pretty cool. Way to turn the situation into a positive. What college did he go to? Pretty sure it was Harvard.  He initially got in trouble when he started the website and it crashed servers.  Then the school realized he hacked into their system to get the pictures of the female students. Oh wow. That is crazy. Did he get kicked out?
i am sad i did not even go to the beach once this summer oh no it sone of my favorite things to do
OH yea he did a real good job yes.  I can't think of anyone better for that part.  His voice made the character It really did. What was your favorite part of the movie I liked the beginning.

i like to ride mopeds . i have a pink one . i enjoy being with friends and family when i am not reading . more of an indoor person ?
The aspect of the imitation game I enjoyed the most is that it's a period piece. Those films transport me to a different world better. And I also like British movies but this one was an American movie that thought it was British. haha. Dude, you're just supposed to read the document, pretend you watched the movie, and chat about it.
o , its okay . its my fault . i do not like wearing pants unless i have to i am 25 and the same way so i understand she also thinks i am terrible at guitar , but i actually really really good at it i have a kid so it is hard to find time to date here i am sorry , you know what cheers me up ? john grisham movies , but not his books . really i did not know that thanks y parents raised me loving them ! hat is pretty cool then i guess yep . they are good people . well , they discovered whilst working in politics
Yeah compared to his newer roles this was definitely one of the more unique ones in the sense that he was taken for granted. I think what you're saying about the possible hidden messages behind his character could definitely be true as the film has a lot of characters like that such as Shaun Toub. I agree with the critics that Gwyneth Paltrow's performance couldn't really be expressed due to her role and the lack of expansion to her character. Exactly, judging from the document, it kind of feels like Shaun's played a very important factor in creating the first Iron man suit, but he is not given recognition as one of the inventors. In fact I think he created the most important part of the sure. Without the electromagnet he created, Start would probably be dead. In this sense I would say that actually makes him the hero in the story. Normally that is how it is with her being a supporting character. There are only a few instances where the love interest in the story get's the attention she deserves. I agree that especially during the time it was released the CGI was amazing and had a very noticeable attention to detail during the action sequences when it was truly shown off.

I forgot that Alan named the machine Christopher.  I thought that was touching. I agree. But at the same time, it almost felt like he couldn't get over him. Like his newest obsession was named after somebody he still longed for. Yea for sure.  It was like his way of holding on to something that wasn't there.

After he stole the Pyramid of Giza he tried to steal the moon. Does he end up stealing the moon? Oh wait I am sorry, somebody else, his rival stole the pyramid. He gets mad and goes to steal the moon. Well he has to get a shrink ray first. Does he use the shrink ray to shrink the moon? Isn't despicable me with the yellow minion characters?

Hello!  How are you? Just watched Bruce Almighty! Pretty okay movie How are you? Great!  I saw it and don't understand why it didn't score higher on Rotten Tomatoes. I understood unfortunately :/ I liked what they were trying to do, and I liked the celebrity cast, but it was too low brow for a 'high concept' comedy At least CinemaScore gave it an A.  I thought the concept of Carrey getting to play God for a week was very original. It didn't want you to think. Yeah. Carrey kinda saved the film for me. He's a pretty insane character actor That he is!  I love his stuff. Morgan Freeman was pretty cool as God, I don't know whether God thought that was funny.
where do you work ? i want to be a gym teacher . i work at a ski resort , at the front desk .
i teach art for third graders . what about you ?
I do! I like all three of them. Although I know John Legend more as a musician than an actor. Legend plays Seb's former classmate Keith, who invites the struggling musician to play keyboards in his jazz fusion band where he would get a steady income. This causes a conflict between Seb and Mia.

What is it about? It shows the behind-the-scenes of the founding of Facebook and the people involved Is there any drama to it? It is a very well made movie There's a ton of drama What's that all about? There were multiple lawsuits involved over who truly created it and who had rights to it Is it based on real life? Jesse Eisenberg plays Mark Zuckerberg and did a great job
I'd say it's an average length movie, about 2 hours Is the plot good? It's great! It's set in 1940 and tells the story of young love and how their lives grow.
www mine loves playing with a laser
me too . i like taking cold showers during the winter ! i need to head on down to the walmart in a minute . re you going to buy the new game halo 3 ?

That is a funny way of thinking, actually! A missle put him there and they he needed to build one to get his freedom back. Would you have trusted Raza and built a missle for him? Definitely not! I'm sure that even if I were to build the missile that he would kill me anyway, and if he didn't I would still be scared of what his intentions were with the missile. It's a terrorist group, they don't have any kind of good intentions in my opinion
Yes, I loved how they bring them to life; it's fun and very well made. It's a movie that can be seen by both adults and children. I was still a kid when it came out and still enjoy it. I was going to say that two of the critics mention that Toy Story successfully brought the characters to life and this made the movie so successful. Do you think the voice actors and animation contributed to the believability of toys being alive? Absolutely, both Tim Allen's and Tom Hanks' acting skills are everything. Personally, I cannot think of other actors that would have done such a great voicing job. I think the rivalry between the two characters voiced by Allen and Hanks is believable as well, as well as the friendship they develop out of that rivalry. You can totally relate to their feelings even though they're toys. Do you generally watch these types of movies?
do you get much free time ? sure , when i am not working or eating pancakes syrup .
I BECAME SOMEWHAT ADDICTED TO SOCIAL MEDIA DURING THE MYSPACE CRAZE. I did have MySpace too! It was the place to be at the time! I learnt basic HTML by messing about with my MySpace profile - I believe it's still ive somewhere! IM NOT SO MUCH ANYMORE still live even! LOL.. I STILL CAN LOG ON TO MINE. SO ARE YOU A STUDENT? So the book was written but i think it was written by someone on the outside looking in rather than someone actually involved in Facebook. No I graduated in 2007. I'm in my 30s now and feel very old when I talk about video cassettes or a Walkman!

Yes, because they were making sexual comments about Leigh Anne, & he defended her. That was so sweet! He was very caring. I was so happy when he decided to go back to the Tuohy family. He did seem very protective. He was accepted to college and said farewell to Tuohy family It was nice that he went to Ole Miss because the Tuohy family went there & he considered them his family. It was nice that he had the opportunity to go to college after everything he suffered. Cotton was impressed by Mike's size and atheleticism Yes. He was.

It could make for a fun movie idea. The new info mentions Steve Carell.  I'm a pretty big fan of his. Love him too! The critics seem mixed on the movie.  But I don't listen to them so much about comedies. Me either especally when the fans like it Good stories are fine, but comedies don't need them to make you laugh I think it's been awhile since Jim Carrey was in a movie.  Haven't noticed him, at least.

oh that sounds pretty interesting and appealing! I do like those actors and actresses too! how are the ratings? Surprisingly, 48% with Rotten Tomatoes, 46/100 Metacritic Score but the CinemaScore was an A little bit all over there place there. so does he do good as being god? Well, the critics think he lost his focus, but it was certainly hilarious!

hI... YES, I have read it Okay. Are you familiar with the movie? Yeah, vaguely. Although I didn't go see it. I didn't either. I read the book in high school, but never got around to seeing the movie. Do you like Leonardo Dicaprio? I want to hate him.. haha for some strange reason.. but I don't actually. He seems like one of the few who qualifies as a bonafide movie star. How about you? I love him. He's one of my favorite actors. I think he is so talented. Carey Mulligan is a great actress too. I like the cast so I would probably enjoy this movie. Yeah i agree the little booger has some acting chops. He gets great roles continually- because he delivers the goods. Agreed. Do you check critic ratings before watching films? Yeah. Now I have heard her name, but wouldn't recognize her, I don't think. Yeah I most want to see stuff I know ahead of time will be worth my time, and money. So ratings/reviews are important to me. I loathe the feeling of being stuck at a crummy movie So it should be 85+ on Rotten Tomatoes :) or I can miss it. But yeah I assume you would see this because you love Leo- and I get that. I'll go to a lesser rated movie if there's a star I really like .. such as Salma Hayek or Johnny Depp. Have you seen other Baz Luhrman movies? he has a very distinct style. *hums theme from Jeopardy* haha ;) okay gotta go.. you musta bailed.. hahah I showered, HONESt! :P hi sorry i had to take care of my daughter

what city are you from ?
No , I didn't I like Hugh Jackman Oh.  Yes, He is a very talented actor. Do you enjoy Science type movies?  If so, you might like this one. I like science movies I knew it was released in 2011 Yeah.  I thought it was a decent movie.  I am not usually a big fan of the genre. but it doesn't have a great ratings though True.  It's a middle of the road peer rating.  However, I find that especially with rotten tomato scores...I still have to judge it for myself.  Their rating system seems to be a bit hit and miss for my own personal tastes. I usuallu trust IMDB ratings better than rotten tomatoes Yes, I agree with that.  They tend to be a bit more reliable.  I haven't watched a ton of Hugh Jackman films.  He seems to be a fairly good actor though. scene 1 seems very encouraging to watch I wasn't aware that the film was based on a short story.  I might have to check that out if it's available. yes , me neither I like Evangiline Lilly too, she is very talented
That's true, I'm not sure how they score these things.
Gru, the supervillian. That must be Steve's character right? Yes. This sounds like a movie I might check out. You said he got 3 little girls. Are these his kids? No, they end up getting adopted by him at the end. He's evil, I don't think he even ever had a girlfriend. Adopted huh? That's interesting considering he's supposed to be a super villain. I am assuming I can watch this with the wife and kids right? Yeah, it's a kid's movie. Cartoon. Steve Carell's character tries to steal the Moon in the movie. This sounds good for them, and yo say the comedy is enough to keep me interested. Lol he tried to break the fourth wall? I think the kids would like that part the most. There's a bit of fourth wall breakage in the film. Who directed the film? Do you know?
haha , sadly they do not like people talking thing like that out or in . yea that is true . that would be awesome though lol i am sure it would , i am more of a wine man myself .
ok , then , bye
interesting my grandchildren do too . i love to go for walks with them and my dog . what is your favorite sport ?
I guess the rating means how much people like it in general? It looks like it got pretty good ratings from other people. I'm not sure I would have rated it that high personally. I would not rated it that high. It seems to be sorta saggy in the middle like most romance movies.
o . i am a person . do not be rude . i will feed you to the lions . i do not want that . would lose the security deposit i just had to pay .
hat is adorable , i do enjoy time with my family , blessed it is
Definitely one of the best directors of our time. He has the ability to do science fiction, historic movies, drama, etc He is very committed to every project and lemme just say, although Ras Al'Gul's plan was evil it was brilliant even the villains in Chris Nolan's world are amazing hint hint: The Joker hahaha The joker performance was out of this world, I mean, that guy nailed it. Thank you! it was nice talking to you Good luck nice talking to you too bye
wesome ! i am trying to get my comic drawing published

so true . are you familiar with adobe
Do you watch movies with high reviews from critics? yes i do Jaws is a 1975 thriller with a rotten tomatoes score of 97%! what is it about? It is about a great white shark which attacks beachgoers. A police chief , marine biologist and professional shark hunter hunt the shark. who are the actors/actresses? It stars Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, Richard Dreyfuss and Lorraine Gary! did it win any awards? I'm not sure did you know that metacritics gave it a score of 87/100? In a key scene a woman goes skinny dipping before she is killed by a shark. what is the movie rated? It has an IMDB rating of 8.0/10 ok, i think i would like to see the movie are there other movies like this? Some critics would argue that it is a sensationally effective action picture a classic Steven Spielberg film did stephen spielberg win an award for the movie? I'm not sure. But in another key scene the beaches open for fourth of July despite warnings from Brody and Hooper that the shark is still on the loose. was this based on a true story at all? I don't know. You may google that if you're wondering. what else can you tell me about the movie?
feelings are dumb and i do not understand them . rolls a 20 less . . . . i want to leave , need to get back to canada oo cold , i like to eat moose though you like to gamble ? yuck lol
llo , how are you ? i really like trucks an i hate vegetables . y only son does not like veggies either . i cannot wait until the holidays i love family time . i am in the army so i do not get family time often . he truck i love is a chevy , a chevy durax . i am sure you do not . ow old are you ? i am 25 . i like fords . i am 20 , that is cool what kind ? ything blue ! its my favorite color . i need something with a lot of space . you do not make sense with your response .
I might have to rent this. It must be funny with those 3 in it.  Are there any women in it? Yes, Gru adopts three girls in connection with his plan to steal things. who plays the 3 girls? Gru sounds hilarious! I am not sure about that but the girls play a huge part in the movie. He is! He keeps giving up things he achieves just to get better things. I'll have to look that info up. You should!
you do a lot of things , very interesting . i doubt i could do shelter work . my husband is a detective , and he is gone a lot . i like to stay busy .
She really did. maybe the reviews are little low because are almost 15 years that this movie has shown In 2003 where the Bruce Almighty is shown there wasn't  so much social media as now That's a good point. CinemaScore gave it an A. So that's something, I guess.
heh, no that sounds like my kinda thing This is probably a spoiler, but there is sort of a happily ever after ending. he and the water creature live happily ever after? There is an implied happy ending from a voiceover narration at the end. ah, so this wasn't a book?
you can beat it ! i was hooked on opium but look at me now !
I like that Alfred raised Bruce after his parents were killed. It shows that he really cares about the family I didn't remember that he got attacked by bats in a well and that's why he's afraid of them! Makes sense hahah Thats true it felt genuine. How well do you think it captures the text of comic book vs bringing it to real life balance? *breaks 4th wall I actually never read the comic books. I don't think I've actually ever read a comic book. But it's hard to not tell this story properly. Everyone knows Batman and I think the movie captured his essence very well What do you think? I agree, it felt referential to the comic books while still bringing the character to real life. What did you think of the critical reception? I'm not to sure about the critical reception, and now that I'm reading the second key scene, I don't think I've actually seen this film hahaha
, that is weird . do you like to read ? what kind of books do you like ? o , but i like to play guitar . do you like music ?
ow many kids do you have ? i have 2 of my own , as well as 30 in my class lol re you a religious person ?
hat is very tempting , i eat way too much fast food . oo . i probably should not but my folks are super busy with work i hate these braces mom made me get , its so hard to eat healthy food . you could put it in a blender . that is what nascar racers to before a race hat is a great idea ! i really want to be a vegetarian for my health . i would rather be rich . that way i can get an ocean home and good doctors . money is great , but happiness is important , too . i would rather be an animal doctor . i think happiness is an illusion which money can help with .
understandable . do you have any other hobbies ? i like to do makeup . what about you ?
o , i have written a few , but it is not my only job . hat is good what else do you do besides writing books ? i work in a diner and cook . just do not ask me to sing ! lol very nice what kinds of foods do you cook at the diner ? whatever a person wants . what do you do for work ? i work as a infant assistant teacher at a daycare hat sounds like a lot of responsibility ! guess you like babies ! yea its not my life longcareer it will work for now what do you want to do for your life long career ?
little tired now but feeling good in general . listening to music . what are you listening to ? i classical music . mozart piano music . i listen to rap to soothe me , i needed it after the 2004 campaign music does help us right ? what else do you do to feel beter ? it sure does . i collect bugs and build computers . wow ! that is cool . but live bugs ? o , they are in specimen jars . i see . so you put them on the shelf for display ? yes , i do . i have over 500 hat is quite a museum ! i am impressed . you seem to be an indoor person . o , i am an avid fisherman and hunter . i started to enlist when i was 18
I also didn't know that Jason Segal played victor Do you let the ratings of movies influence whether you watch them or not? I think I heard that some where. Im suprised how many famous actors do voice acting for Pixar movies. It took me a while to recognize the voice of the main character from Monsters vs Aliens. It was Reese Witherspoon! I did not know that, but I think Steve Carell did a good job as the voice of Gru in this movie. Definitely. The kids were adorable I like the part in the movie when Gru gets the kids to warm up to him! They really were! I still quote "Its so fluffy!!" lol Did you like the ending? I did not like when Vector kidnapped the girls.
It was indeed, and now gives you more of a reason to go see it! Yes, both are men One tall and skinny, the other short and chubby quite the opposites! Did kevin get hurt at alll throughout the film?
ot a vegetables guy , i love meat i have been a vegan since 5 yrs old shame
ow can i put it like those who have them ? i am not understanding your question . ow can i make life complete with out them ? well i volunteer at a humane society and meet lot so people .
music festival tickets for sure . you ? xperience rather than tangibles , i see . i would say shoes .
Is it an action packed movie? He's voiced by steve carell so it's funny. He's a pretty good actor. Are there minions in this movie? Yeah I like steve carell. has russel brand in it too, I also like him. Russel Brand is great. What was your favorite part of the movie? lol i'm not sure how to answer that.... technically I'm only supposed to tell you about what's in the document they gave me to read... they didn't even say anything about the minions on the doc! this exercise is rediculous... Gotcha, yeah I was playing along with what they said as well. I can't see the doc. The primary purpose my guess is to make sure the chat function is operating. I have no idea. lol. So Steve is in the doc. What else is the movie about? We'll just keep going I guess lol. ok yeah he adopts some girls from an orphanage Cool, the movie already sounds interesting. Its a comedy? (I've seen the movie dozens of times just going along with the exercise)

Absolutely. If you think it's great watching Frozen, just wait until you see the advancements in Coco. .. referring to 3D animation OH . must be good . have to wait for it to come out on blue ray the rock trolls are funny All the actors they chose for the movie were fantastic I agree and so vocally talented I had no idea Kirsten Bell could sing . I wouldn't expect anything less from Disney, truth be told Disney is pretty top notch neither did I. I was a little more familiar with idina Menzel HAve to up hold the disney legacy absolutely. Disney sets a high standard to meet IT is disneys 53rd animated film I saw that. That's impressive. I love that the movie is set the same universe as other movies . like hidden easter egs

Hello there! hello! first off, I am a Marvel fan over DC so this is good lol i respect any man made out things harder than wood, so im pleased too The ratings are pretty good also from all sources, A from CinemaScore, 79/100 from meta critic (which im not familiar with) and 94% on rotten tomatoes. 7.7 out of ten! and critics seem to like it. the cgi seemed to be a central theme. do you think it had a lot to do with the approval overall of the film? I think so, it was very well produced, also had a nice cast of well known actors. who couldnt love RDJ he's a legend as timeless as iron man himself! you cant cast terrance howard and gwenyth paltrow and not have a nice film. they might have been given a bit of an overly produced film but they really made it work judging by this person's review, they weren't impressed. "a slightly depressed, going-through-the-motions feel to the entire show [...] GwynethPaltrow, widening her eyes and palpitating, can't do much with an antique role as Stark'sgirl Friday, who loves him but can't say so; Terrence Howard, playing a military man whochases around after Stark, looks dispirited and taken for granted"" I mean as with all superhero movies, DV or Marvel, they are pretty much all the same, its har dto put a new spin on the good guy/bad guy thing Are you there?

Patrick Denham plays an FBI agent who tries to take him down. Matthew McConaughey always plays Jordan's mentor. ok and is this a true story or fiction? what happens to Leo? This is a true story. It got a 7.8 On Rotten Tomatoes. He first takes a job in penny stocks where he uses an aggressive pitching style to gain a larger commission. Making himself a small fortune. sounds like he got greedy 7.8 is not a good rateing He certainly did. It really just started as a way to be able to pay his bills. 78% is still better than a failing grade! One of the better black comedy movies. ok sorry thought it said 7.8 So did he have a family? and what happened to make him commit fraud?
i do not like to go to clubs or anything like that .

I wonder what "stereotypes" they're talking about. I believe it refers to having a strong female character who doesn't need a man to validate and empower her. She is strong on her own. Oh I see.  I like Angelina Jolie. What else can you tell me about the movie? Maleficent is a powerful fairy who falls in love with a human peasant. They grow apart and he ends up betraying her terribly. Maleficent is devastated and turns the Moors, where she lives, into a dark kingdom.

It looks like it is a good movie overall it made a 94% on rotten tomatoes which I guess is pretty difficult Robert Downey Junior has done amazing with Iron Man id have to agree, they usually rate harsh and yeah he is perfect for the role Oh I forgot Terrence Howard was in this movie as well ehh i dont care much for him Robert Downey Junior does a great job is this genius Playboi Tony Stark He’s hit or miss for me yeah he is a stud, very fun character
I never thought it was scary. I love the water and after we saw jaws when I was a little kid I had to look up the stats about shark attacks. I did like Richard Dreyfuss in this movie though. Wow. I did not go into the ocean for a long time. Maybe because I lived in Rhode Island. I thought the Richard Dreyfus character was awesome. Very different from the book but he was great.My fav character though was Quint. He was the best. I liked Quinn too, but what really bothered me about this movie was that theu were concerned with shark attacks but did nothing to keep the tourists out of the water. The attach scenes were a little too gruesome. I remember my father had to take my little brother out of the movie but I stayed with my mother. I think that was the first movie I saw that made me scared in real life too. I don't even think I saw what the shark looked like until I watched the movie on TV. My eye were closed most of the time. Aw that's cute. The scenes were scary as kids, but watching it now and comparing it to some of the horror movies today makes kids say that was scary? I remember watching it with my young daughter and her friend at the time on TV one afternoon and they were making fun of me because I was telling them to hide their eyes. They laughed at me and said it was so fake. They grew up with Discovery Channel and Shark Week. lol I know, children are so jaded lately.  Iaughed at the description where they said it was too gruesome for children. I think it was R rated when it came out. I am not sure what is was rated but my parents took me. Must have been the popularity at the time. I remember everyone screaming not just the kids. Lots of people walked out.  Too bad we are so used to violence and gore now.
i rest for 3 hours a day i am quite tired
I have not seen Dick and Jane, but I remember that coming out around the same time as this movie if I remember correctly. It was so funny! Jim Carrey is a great actor! What is one of the main scenes in Bruce Almighty?
o . just coffee and soy drinks .
he does actually , right by our favorite pizza place . we love pizza . i was wanting to go back to school , but not that school now . happened out of nowhere . oh i am sorry . maybe we could go get a pizza sometime . you single ? yes i am . do you like to watch netflix ? yep , i watch a lot of netflix being single too haha i have been watching making a murder and now self defense classes are near maybe we should do that together . i am sure my dad would love me to take classes
Disney really knows how to create some great visuals that's for sure lol Robert Stromberg has done some good work Oh yeah, the Moors, that forest.  I remember that I'm not quite familiar with him. What other movies has he done?
Leonardo DiCaprio. Do you like science fiction movies? Oh he is a good actor. I am not a huge science fiction fan though. Do you generally watch movies with good ratings? Users rated this 8.1 out of 10. Yes I do. That is a pretty high rating. If I remember correctly that movie won several Oscars. Do you pay attention to what the critics have to say about a movie? Sometimes I do but sometimes I pay more attention to a movies trailer to see if it may interest me. If you like DiCaprio you might like this movie. One critic said that it will draw you in with a love story that will appeal even to non-sci-fi fans. A love story? That does sound interesting. I like more comedies and romance movies. Who plays the love interest in the movie?
wow that is debilitating . i get agitated easily i hate that part or me yes this broken leg is agitating ! i hate the taste of green beans . . it is so gross i love green beans especially the french style !
i am the oldest , my little sis is in first grade i would love to hear one of your dad stories . i really like to laugh . what you got baking today ? i am working on a wedding cake for the weekend .
hello ! what do you do for a living ? i work around here and there oh ? do you use a nice pen for that ? what kind of pen ? i do not have a pen what ? that is awful . i use a pen . its black . super smooth .
That is a nice name. Is he the only big star? Um, I am not sure. But I think more adult. no he is not. Ok, well do you think the plot is good? Ellen Page plays adrienne. I know her from other films. Josepg gordon levitt is also in it. Joseph Ya I like her. I have seen him in some films too. Me too. Both are talented. What is the movie about? The concept is pretty different, cobb recruits adrienne/ellen to create a dream world. So, is it like a fantasy movie? But there actually in this world.
Yes, he's a great actor.  I didn't know he did Woody Yes he did. The "secondary" main character is Buzz Lightyear that's voiced by Tim Allen. I'm sure you know who that is? Yeah Home Improvement.  Sounds like they have a lot of talent in that movie They really do. The toys are owned by a kid named Andy who's moving to a new house and of course he's going to take his toys with him. oh yeah, and what ends up happening Throughout the movie I believe the toys are trying to not get left behind but Andy can only take so many toys (it's been so long that I myself can't remember all the details) yeah I can't either, just rremember it being good.  Isn't there some jealousy between Woody and Buzz like who's Andy's favorite toy or something Yeah Woody and Buzz fight with each other because Andy got Buzz as a present and he's much cooler than Woody. A lot of jealousy over who's Andy's favorite toy. yeah that's what I thought.  but they end up resolving things I think right I want to say they do end up resolving things but I can't remember exactly how, unfortunately. I don't either Do you remember any of the other characters like Mr. Potato Head, The Piggy Bank, Dinosaur? yes!!! so funny So Buzz accidently gets knocked out of the window by Woody and all the rest of the toys turned against him lol
He took his whole family I believe!!!  I would definitely like to know his occupation and have it!!  What was that kids name that starred in it? His name was kevin. He sure was a savy little kid keeping those robbers at bay! Not sure my 8 year old could handle that! I know mine couldn't!  I could only imagine what my house would look like if I went off without him for any length of time! Absolutely! Marv and harry the robbers would get away with everything if it happened in real life at my house. It was surely a unique concept for a comedy movie in 1990! Weren't their sequels to it? I dont know! I do think kevin getting sent to the third floor for punishment seems silly. Being thats why they managed to leave him behind, i assume thatll no longer be a punishment at the mccallister house! I would hope not!  Didn't he have to sleep with the bed wetter? Haha! I dont remember that! I had also forgotten it was based outside of chicago. That explains the winter storm they got the night before they left for the airport! oh yeah! That reminds me of the old man that all the kids were scared of that shoveled the snow!

i am from texas . the best place to go is jamaica
I wouldn't say "betrayed" , but yeah it was annoying When you rewatch this movie, note that Stane is the person who has a massive new super suit that was reverse engineered from the wreckage of Stark's old suit. was it in Ironman 1 ?
Oh, dear.   I really like Leonardo DiCaprio, so might get something out of the movie just by virtue of him being in it. I think the movie looks twisted and confusing.

hello! hello pal Hi. What kind of movies do you like? Have you seen Inception? I do love movies with good story line and nice concepts Inception????? I am not sure It has Leonardo DiCaprio in it. may if you jog my memory wow, that must be big then He plays a thief who cons people out of their secrets by hacking into their dreams while they are asleep. what's the genre of the movie? It came out in 2009 It's in the scientific genre. way back 2009? i am shocked i havent watched it you mean science fiction? who else starred in the movie asides Leonardo D? Yeah, it could fall into science fiction. But it is mostly scientific since the characters use science to sedate people into falling asleep. Joseph Gordon Levitt is in it also. Along with Ellen Page, and Tom Hardy. wow, then it should be a movie to see for me! Joseph plays the character named Arthur, who is a friend of Dom Cobb (Leo), and he helps Dom by managing and researching their missions. Together they are considered "extractors" who extract info from people while asleep. Some of the dream go haywire, as you can probably imagine. They use experimental military technology to infiltrate the subconscious. how would you rate the movie on a scale of 1-10? I saw it when it first came out, I would give it about an 8 or a 9. Rotten Tomatoes gives it an 8.1 out of 10. that means the movie must be similar to sherlock holmes A bit less detective than Sherlock Holmes, but very mysterious like that.
can you tell me what information you got in the document Who plays Gordon? so we can make the question according to that A summary of the plot, a cast list of actors and characters, numerical ratings and critical reviews. we will make question from this summary who is the director of this movie Christopher Nolan. Wow! What is the plot of the movie Is there any Key Scenes Plot: It tells the tale of Bruce Wayne from the death of his parents to his journey to become Batman, defending Gotham from Scarecrow and Ra’s Al Ghul. wow so very nice Is there any key scene In which year movie was released ? As a child, Bruce Wayne falls down a well and I surrounded by a swarm of bats. He develops a phobia of the bats. While at the opera with his parents, Thomas and Martha Wayne, he becomes frightened of actors playing bats, and asks to leave. Outside, his parents are mugged and killed by the criminal shoe Chill. The orphaned Bruce is then raised by his butler Alfred. 2005 2005. Wow! this is an awesome sequence that's great! what is the rating for this movie Rotten Tomatoes gives it an 84% and an average of 7.7/10z That's great what about CinemaScore A
yeah! I thought that one was hilarious too.. I have only seen bits a pieces of it, but anything with Steve Carell in it is usually pretty good.
i also have strong prescription lenses so toes are actually my best feature . i am trying to picture you . . . . . . listening to bach at the moment
i like the hulk he is great too I like going to theaters on $5 day and see them a couple times some critic don't like iron man they say he's a team player but his finest express is self irony i dont agree i don't agree either very good point that a lot of people don't see i think all the avenger are great and if i went to see a movie for $5.00 i would also watch all day I love to collect items too did you know that rotten tomatoes gave that avengers a 92% rating and i agree with them i know, they deserve it do you think chris hemsworth makes a good thor yes, very great i think all of the actors/actress fit the part they do, makes it so realistic what do you think of joss whedon the director very good and pretty amazing
I really did too. We both should watch it. I still can't believe how low the reviews were. Do you find that you generally disagree with movie reviews?
the movie titled " The Notebook" It was a romatic movie It was directed by Nick Cassabetes. Do you know this Movie have you watcehd it? i dont see what year it was release? It was given a 52% rating by the Rotten Tomatoes who are the main character Main Actor was Ryan Gosling as Noah Calhoun what you like in the movie? Rachel McAdams as Allison "Allie" Hamilton It was a narated movie Animated??? It is a love story of two young lovers and the  story was from the past  1946, i think it was like titanic? The movie was based a Novel by Nicholas Spark  "Notebook" release in 1996 what was the tuning point of the movie? like the main part ? NO but maybe just the same because it was a Romantic Drama movie.. action? comedy? Noah writes to Allie every day for a year but Anne intercepts the letters and they never reachAllie. Noah enlists with Fin to fight in World War II, where Fin is killed in battle. Allievolunteers in a hospital for wounded soldiers, where she meets officer Lon Hammond Jr., ayoung lawyer who comes from old Southern money. The two become engaged, to thedelight of Allie's parents.When Noah returns from the war, his father has sold their home so that Noah can buy theabandoned house. While visiting Charleston, Noah witnesses Allie and Lon kissing at arestaurant; he convinces himself that if he restores the house, Allie will come back to him.Allie is startled to read in the newspaper that Noah has completed the house to thespecifications she made years before. that was in the story A Romantic drama oh do you watched or do you like Romantic Drama movies? very nice yeah I think I would like to watched this movie to check.. How about you? yes shure i would thanks for information yeah me too.. welcome.. its nice to talk to you i think nice talk between us bye Thank you

Give it a try the next time you go to the cinema! Can you tell me a little about it? Who is in the movie? Batman vs superman is like connecting two different worlds, with different lore and super heroes! you have Ben Affleck as Batman and Henry Cavill as Clark Kent but in my opinion the role here that stand out among the others is the one of Jesse Eisenber as Lex Luthor Jesse Eisenberg the cast, as you can see, is really great I love all of those actors. This movie takes place before Wonder Woman and Justice League, correct? I can´t give you a precise answer but probably yes since this movie debuted first than those two. I wonder what they will try to do with this movies will they gather all of them in a movie in the future? would be nice I just hope they include joker in the future Batman without Joker loses some interest I completely agree. He is the perfect villain for Batman. Is there something you can tell me about the conflict between Batman and Superman? I assume "Vs" means they are fighting. How did it start? Good question :)) I would say it started because  the figure of God as Superman conveys, could be a threat to human race. At least in BATMAN´S MIND. SINCE AS you know Superman cannot be killed So Batman is suspicious of him? More than suspicious, I would say that this battle was more one about egos that due to a real reasons. Batman did not think that Superman was needed Does Batman doubt Superman's intentions? Or is just a difference of ideas? I would say that at the beginning he doubts of superman´s real intentions but as a new threat arises in the movie, they put behind their differences and decide to face the real enemy lex luthor any more question? Yes I could see how difficult it could be to see a God like figure. Does Batman have prior knowledge of Superman or is their first meeting in this movie? I think we are done here :)
Has he played any serious movie roles like a drama? I am not sure about that. He seems to be more of a comedian type actor. Do you know any other movies by this director? If you were in a similar situation as Bruce (like in the key scene mentioned), would you feel frustrated as well? I have not heard of any other movies by this director.

Hello! Have you seen any good movies lately? Hello, yes I have one in particular in mind.  Have you seen the Avengers? NO not yet!   How was it? It came out in 2012 starring Robert Downey Jr. as well as Chris Evans and Mark Ruffalo.  It is based on the Marvel Comics superhero team!  Walt Disney STudios made it. Is this the very first Avengers ?I guess there are a few right? I am not certain about that, but it's called The Avengers so it is probably the first.  Samuel L. Jackson is also in it!  It really has a fantastic cast.  It got incredible reviews, too, with Rotten Tomatoes giving it a 92% and an A+ from Cinematics. Awsome ! Is there a lot of action?

Yeah I've seen it multiple times My favorite characters are the T-Rex and the Piggy Bank. I am not surprisee it has gotten such high ratings on rotten tomatoes It's a masterpiece of cinema. This is like one of the first CGI movies ever produced by the company that would become pixar I think they were already pixar when they made this. Disney studios produced yet another great master piece have you seen any of their other earlier works Probably I was a little kid when Toy Story came out.  It's hard to remember all the movies I've seen. Where was Andy's dad? actually this is the first movie ever made in cgi form by pixar that was disney at the time they were not the hit nor were they big until this Seriously where was Andy's dad?  He's not in any of the 3 movies. there were big name actors included in this to help move it, tom hanks, tim allen, and don rickles this also helped debut some other careers like that of director john lasseter, have u seen any of his other works? Did you know Tim Allen was arrested for marijuana and it wasn't like a small amount it was POUNDS. did you know thats not part of the movie or how this works? This is the first animated comedy action adventure movie made by cgi format, have you seen other cgi formatted movies?
yes true. Another interesting scene is that Diana rescues American pilot captain when his plane crashes off the Themyscrian coast There are lot of such interesting scenes in the movie which impressed audiances That Spanish chief Isabel Maru was sure up to no good with developing that mustard gas! You will definitely love this movie Everyone I know basically has seen it and I haven't heard a bad thing about it at all. It certainly has piqued my interest. Sounds exciting when Ares destroys the "Godkiller" sword! It got 76/100 in Metacritic Score Rotten Tomatoes gave it a 92%! That sounds awesome.
what do you teach at the catholic school ?
broadway is fun , but my preference is nascar ! woooooo i also like dancing , like dancing with the stars hat is cool ! you know what makes everything better ? eating mcdonald ! i like mcdonald coffee , its better than the coffee house i work at wow , really ? ? ? best time eating mcdonald while watching nascar

did you like the movie? I have seen the movie, my kids really enjoyed it i did enjoy it as well i see that it scored very well on movie reviews
I thought his changing forms was crazy looking. especially his wings and eyes were looks impressive eexactly! Maleficent became increasingly scary during the film. especially she acted some of intense scenes very natural and they really scared little kids I was blown away by it.

Yeah I agree! Michael Shannon makes a great enemy, and Richard Jenkins is always a great character actor. Yes, I always try to check out the movies that win Best Picture. More often than not they are good. Do you know how we tell when we are done? Yeah, I have that habit too. And Guillermo del Toro totally deserved that award. His work is always pleasant to watch! Yeah, I liked Pan's Labyrinth too I try to follow what he is doing and watch most of his films Do you know what else we are supposed to do for this HIT? I'm not sure what the next step is Surely, Pan's Labyrinth is one of the movies for what he will be remembered. Yes, he has a way of creating different worlds and interesting creatures.

Hi have you seen the first "John Wick"? No, I haven't,,,,,have you? Yes it's an outstanding action movie. Maybe a bit over the top but it is entertainment. Do you like action films? I do like action films but it mainly depends on who is in it Who are actors? This is a Keanu Reeves film. I cant decide if his dry, semi-stolid, personality fits or not. It has a lot of violence so the it fits the action bill. Keanu Reeves, Alfie Allen, Michael Nyqvist, Adrianne Palicki and John Leguizamo The cast is good, I will consider watching this  movie Who is your favorite actor from this list? You should. You'll enjoy it. Tough to say. You get mostly Keanu through the majority of the film. Leguizamo plays a dirt bag well. He definitely gets the look and tones right anyway. Oh, but sounds interesting
ice . i hate waiting in line to get food .
reat i have a sleepover this weekend very cool . i live in a terrible neighborhood , so i cant do that . it is for a friend he finally catching up and turning 10 ww . my mom is in poor health , so it is just me . wow my dad works so much i rarely see him but my mom is my teacher hat is horrible , parents should not have to work so much . it makes me popular at school but i feel like it is wrong it is wrong . parents need to be there for their kids . i mean cause she teacher , we have a big house oh , yes . i was popular because i had a pool . wow you understand me ! my best friend is milo my dog and cat named oreo hose are cute names , my last dog was sirius . i had to give my dog nutmeg to the vet he was very sick
Not to mention Elsa had suppressed her magic as she was growing up. The king and queen were probably trying their best interest for safety Then, Elsa reaches 21 and then she unleashes her powers as a result of Anna's love interest. Why do you think Elsa objected to the proposal? I guess she didn't want to feel lonely and afraid. That makes sense, it's too bad because she ended up alone in a palace of ice anyway The castle Elsa built of ice was beautiful but cold.

That sounds like a fun movie. Would you recommend this movie for kids?
Yes, I own it on Blu-Ray Oh, cool! Way to go! I have seen it many times and will see it many more times. Have you seen it? Yes, I did. Did you enjoy it? Yes, of course. Ruffalo is the quite the revelation. Besides, it's hard not to when it's starring Robert Downey Jr. Robert Downey Jr. is just perfect as Iron Man/Tony Stark. I was skeptical with Ruffalo as Hulk but he has pulled it off many times. He sure has. He turns Banner into a wry reservoir of calm, ready to become a volcano. It was nice seeing all of them working together. Loki is one of my favorite villains. Yeah, it's cool how Loki uses the Tesseract in conjunction with the device Selvig built, to open the wormhole above Strak Tower. I meant Stark Tower I'm glad Selvig was in this one, he was great in the Thor movies. I did like that Tony pretty much saved the city by diverting the nuke towards the end.

hey hey have you seen jaws? I have, many times its a movie from 1975 Yes, its a classic thats a long time ago. longer than i thought it was a year after the novel of the same name written by peter benchley Yeah, he wrote a lot of good books but this is a great classic movie in hindsight you wouldnt think itd be such a classic its just a movie about a shark they wanted to use the shark more in production, but it broke all of the time so thats why you barely see it in the movie it worked out better that way ah that makes sense i suppose it may have made it more ominous Yeah, maybe so they thought the shark was a tiger shark at first but i think this movie helped make great white sharks seem even more dangerous Oh yeah like they were the kings of the shark world thats for sure, I know it scared me when I thought about water so that worked this movie was critically acclaimed too 97% on rotten tomatoes Oh yeah, it made spielbergs career he was nothing before that yeah metacritic rated it 87 out of 100 and imdb gave it 8 out of 10 great reviews

I can't believe it's been over 40 years ago since it was released (1975). Yeah...makes me feel really old.  lol It's hard to pick just one favorite!... I know! I still don't like swimming in the ocean because of Jaws. I watched it on the big screen when it first came out.  I was 13 years old at the time.  Scared me so much, I didn't even want to take a bath for a couple of months.  :D I didn't realize that it was actually based off a book. Stephen Spielberg did such a great job directing. Yes.  I had read the book first, so sort of knew what to expect. I need to watch it again, my kids are a little young to see it though, since it's so gruesome. Richard Dryfuss was exceptional in that movie.  He added the right amount of humor to it. Lorraine Gary fit the character of Ellen Brody so well. Yes, she did.  When I watch it these days, I kinda have to laugh because the shark looks so robotic.  Can you imagine if they made the original today with how far they've come in movie making.  It would look so real! It really would be a great movie to be remade. But then again, it would be hard to beat the first. The first one was so highly rated. Yes, hard to remake an original.Now...is Jaws the movie we are supposed to be reviewing.  I didn't see where they asked us to talk about Jaws, did you? I am supposed to be talking about Jaws. I'm sure they couldn't do a re-make that would do the original Jaws justice. Spielberg just has a talent most directors now days could only dream about having.

Ha ha, I don't know. but I don't think so. I think they might have settled the lawsuit so they wouldn't have to duke it out in court. And his lawyer didn't think Zuckerberg would be a sympathetic person in the jurors' eyes. He doesn't look like he would be sympathetic. Someone is always trying to get something for nothing!

Would you say it has a happy ending to it? I haven't seen LA LA land either. Which one would you recommend? Yes. They kill the Shark and get to relax and be happy in the end Aw man, spoilers haha Honestly I would recommend jaws. It's such a great classic movie Why not La La land? Do you not like it? What genre is La La land? LA LA land is OK but it doesn't compare to the action of Jews. I give it a 7.8 whereas jaws is a 9.1 LA LA land is a musical romantic Comedy Hmm, you might have to convince me a little more about Jaws just because I already know the ending. Since you said LA LA Land is a romantic comedy, is there any romance in Jaws? And is LA LA Land based on a real story? No. Jaws has little romance
oh wow that sounds interesting Yes, I would recommend watching it in the future

Justice League was a little better but also seemed like it was put together in a hurry. It seems that SuperMan is not dead after all. It is like nothing has happened after all. How do you feel about the ending ?

YES BUT IT IS A ADVENTURE AND COMEDY MOVIE Are there any big name actors in it ? Jenny Slate as Dawn Bellwether, a diminutive sheep who is the assistant mayor ofZootopia. Shes a good actress. So all the actors play animals in the movie ? YES ALL THE ACTORS ARE GOOD Do you know when the movie is released ? I would like to see it. I DON'T KNOW YOU KNOW THAT Do you think it would be a good movie for kids to watch ? YES IT IS AN ANIMATION MOVIE WHERE ARE YOU FROM WHAT IS YOUR NAME I'm from TX, my name is Kevin.

It's like you get to know who Batman really is and how a superhero without any superpowers handles shit what would you rate it out of 10, with 10 being the best? 8 for Batman Begins. This movie got a rating of 7.7 out of 10.
Seems so.At least the general idea is around this.
i love to shop and to sleep
The trailer made it seem like it could be a decent movie. How come it isn't a good movie to you? It only got 48% on Rotten Tomatoes and a Metacritic Score of 55/100 Those are pretty poor scores. I tend to trust those opinions. Plus I don't see a lot of movies, so I wouldn't waste my time on one with low scores. Have you seen The Great Gatsby? Yes, and I was upset that the stand out actor Joel Edgerton was given such a 1 dimensional role. Yeah, that would totally bother me as well. I really appreciate good writing with good acting. It sucks when a great actor doesn't have good writing to thrive with. My friend's had a birthday that was Gatsby themed and it was fun. What did you think of wardrobe and the setting? Did the movie do that well? That does sound fun. The film had a $190 million budget so the wardrobe and sets were top notch. I'll give the movie credit for that. But I still don;t think it;s worth watching when there' s so many better movies out there. I completely agree. Watching a movie is all about being entertained. I can only marvel at the scenery and costumes for so long. I tend to not like romantic dramas much anyway. What about you? Other than Romeo and Juliet, me neither. I love comedy and documentaries. Make me laugh or teach me something. What do you like?

one of the greats one thing I can tell you is that it is worth watchin. Rotten Tomatoes has ait at 97% with an average of 9.2/10. wow that is impressive if you haven't ever watched it, I would suggest to see it at some point because it is one of the greats. I find it impressive because RT usually has the worst ratings for movies. do you thrillers? I think I will watch it sometimes definitely give it a shot. you will like it if you like Steven Spielberg and his movies. even more you may find some humor in it

I have not seen the movie, though I have heard good things. Where is the setting? It takes place mainly in New York City. The main character of the movie who is played by Leonardo Dicaprio lives on the Gold Coast on Long Island. Is he a stock broker? He is.  When you watch the movie, you should also know that he is a corrupt stock broker for a company called Stratton Oakmont. Do you like movies that are black comedies? That sounds like a good premise. I do like black comedies as well I love the scene where his wife finds out about his corruption because she totally leaves him and it shows how his life took a downward spiral. That sounds like a really good movie, thank you!

The Incredibles I would like to know more about this story What happens in the plot? What** Well, it's pretty simple really.  Woody is Andy's favorite toy until he gets Buzz Lightyear for Christmas.

Poor Woody Thereafter, they attempt to return to Andy's room, and have many difficulties getting there. Well, he has to learn to be the second favorite toy.  A toy serves the child. Do they get lost somewhere in the house or outside the house? They get lost mostly at the neighbor's house, who is very vicious towards his own toys.

I liked Keira Knightley in the movie too But then he married - which seems odd. Yes she is good. Oh yeah that was right about the Enigma machine being destroyed. Very emotional scene I liked how they figured out how to break the code with the weather announcement Feel really bad for Clarke. You would think she would have known he was gay, but it seems she was blind to it. And then Caimcross being a spy !! and then Turing confronts him and all heck breaks loose! Yeah. Also so emotional that they couldn't act on every message that they had to stand by while they knew people would die

Was this a action flick? There is action in it, and adventure. Tell me about the adventure. It starts with Frank living in New Rochelle, New York as a teen. His father tries to get a loan but fails because of some kind of IRS problem so they end up in a little apartment. His parents divorce and Frank runs away. Of course, he runs out of money and starts doing scams. Oh. This reminds me of another adventure movie. So it isn't the chase scene, shoot-em-up, the action never stops kind of action film, but there are some bits of action. Mainly it is humorous. What movie were you thinking of? So he's not really a bad guy in the movie? I can't remember the name, but the young son left home because of his dad's money problems and began robbing banks.

Did it get good reviews? A first no, but it's a cult classic. Oh okay Are there any other memorable scenes The various scenes with the booty traps are the key of the movie, you'll remember each and every one. That sounds funny. Is this a kids movie? Or is funny for adults too?

Can't remember the last time I saw Holly Hunter working either.  What has she been up to all this time?! I did like Amy Adams as Lois Lane- she was awesome! I didn't know who Henry Cavill was until I saw this movie. I didn't realize that, in the movie, Batman had already been working for 20 years. What?  I didn't know that either! Yeah, I thought it was a reboot and we were going to see some new origin story. How is it possible that Superman could be viewed as a threat to humanity? I was just going to say that. I don't get why Bruce Wayne doesn't like Superman. They should be crime fighting buddies It makes sense that Lex was playing the two superheroes against each other, Oh, that figures.  It is all Lex Luthor's fault. What did you think of the "Martha" moment? I had never put it together that they both had mothers named Martha. I was surprised that Batman fought Superman instead of just listening to him and his story. And Batman went to a lot of trouble to make the spear. I couldn't believe they killed off Superman. The engagement ring moment- so sad! I loved Diana Prince! Wonder Woman for the win! I agree!  Wonder Woman has always been a personal favorite. And yes, the engagement ring moment was very sad Do you think Superman is really dead? How could he be? That would be awful! And the levitating dirt has to mean something, right? That's what I was thinking.  And you know there will be a sequel now too.

Foxes are known for being sly and intelligent. I would guess they're trying to show that their cunning can be used for good as well as bad. Ha ha that's true. What about the mayor as a sheep? That's a good one. I guess the mayor just isn't very creative or unique. He just follows what those on the city council want. That's why it takes Judy, the lowly meter maid, to spark all of this action! Did the Night Howlers creep you out? Well I love horror movies and scary stuff so I found them pretty cool. I could imagine how they might scare little kids though.

I think that was a main turning point for the story. yes turning point  ...is hightlight the story this flim american historical drama film....so nice script The script is definitely top notch. My favorite part is when they finally crack the Enigma machine, but can't save all the lives, or the Germans will realize what he's done yes sad of the end. but script right choice end of the script very impress My Favorite actor was Benedict Cumberbatch. His acting skills are great! me too Benedict cumberbatc ....SO GOOD ACTING I LOVE THAT He makes you feel like the story is actually happening right there in front of you YES AFCORSE This movie was based on the BBC TV Show called Breaking the Code. I've never seen it before, but this movie makes me want to watch it. OHH THIS IMPERMATION IS NEW ONE FOR ME....BUT IAM IMPRESS THIS FILM Yes, me too. What I like is that it's based on a true story. All of the characters were real people, and the Enigma machine was a real thing. YEAH ITS VERY TRULY STORY ........PUBLIC ENJOY THE STORY IN CINEMA I loved it in the cinema too. I was so worried in the scene where they weren't sure if they could get the decoding machine to work or not. So suspenseful! APRECIATE THE DIRECTOR .TECHINICAL WRK OUT ASSAAM
do you listen to country music ? it is my favorite . yup , i do listen sometime . but my favorite is dancing you would be good to have in one of my shows that i act in .
Yeah, maybe because it was too much for kids with the violence etc. The critical responses aren't that much good either Could be its called a dark fantasy after all I like the concept though, and how they brought sleeping beauty and Maleficent into it. A lot of people don't realize who they are and why it played out the way it did. Right. Yep, it demolished a lot of stereotypes says one critical response What's the stereotype? Probably has to do with women Malificent plays a very strong character

i am not really into sports . i will watch football every once in a while . i wish i had time to learn to cook like you do . someday maybe !
I thought the story kind of lost interest in the middle.Did you find this to be true? I agree with the idea of a more melodramatic plot. There definitely were parts where the plot and characters seemed a little dull and  sort of lost interest, but that happens in almost every movie. Overall i think its a fine movie but i dont really get why critics rated it so high i just dont see it as that amazing. What did you think about the acting? Do you think the characters were true to life? For the most part the acting was good, some of the writing was a bit dull tohugh, as far as true to life i found it kind of odd that this middle aged white guy was the one saving jazz which is a traditionally African american genre, what did you think about that? I agree that the ratings seemed a little high for this movie.I dont pay much attention to ratings anyways do you? I agree jazz was founded by the black culture of the day and probably was influenced very little by white society. No not usually as long as i like a movie critics opinions dont matter. So what did you thing of the scene where Sebatian was fired for singing jazz instead of Christmas and then met up with Mia again months later, i tohught it was  kind of cute but also pretty typical of a movie like this.
It's more drama. He gets shuffled around in foster homes, and keeps running away. A friend's father ends up contacting the coach of the private school to see if they can get him in that school. That's cool, I like dramas.  What happens when he starts playing football? He makes friends with a kid (Leigh Anne and Sean's son). And they ended up adopting him. He was really good and became one of the most coveted prospects in college football. It's a true story. Does his family not care about him or did they day? He ended up being drafted by the Ravens. I'm not sure what happened to his biological parents. Is all of that in the movie, or does the movie end with just backstory from childhood?
yes , my sister lives there
brown hair is cool too !
Hi Hi So it looks like this was a movie well perceived by the critics
i how are you today ood , i have a job at a local museum hat is a nice job to have i make pizza at a pizza place in chicago well i prefer trips to the local park hat sounds like a fun thing to do in downtime . i am a drummer in a rock band bop bop bp , cool . lets just say i read quite a lot ! what kind of books do you like to read ? wheelchairs books , as i am in a wheelchair and stuck there . hat sounds miserable being stuck in a wheelchair lets just say that with friend , i do not have many hat is not cool sometimes friends can be great do you have any siblings reading a lot is what i like to do .
hat is amazing ! i make customized items
Yeah. I'm not sure if he really fits jazz though. It doesn't seem like his genre. I think the scene with him disregarding the setlist and brushing Mia off is appropriate for his personality as he seems like someone who would be a bit full of himself, not caring about the rules or what other people think. Gosling's character seems to be trying to ignore the overtures of Mia and making himself "hard to get". Yeah, I didn't see it that way at first. I only know what I'm reading about it and it seems like he really takes his time warming up to her. Yeah. I think it's a smart decision on the director's part though because the audience wants them to be together. Taking so long keeps them on their toes and makes them want to keep watching to see if they do end up together.
No, I think only one person gets to read about it. You tell me about it. All I have is the conversation box. I like empowerment. Tell me more.

It is called The Wolf of Wall Street.  It's a "black comedy" about a stockbroker who is pursued by the FBI for corruption! That's with Leo DiCaprio, right? I haven't seen it. Is it good? That's right!  And it has other stars like Jonah Hill, Margot Robbie, and and Rob Reiner.  On Rotten Tomatoes it scores a 7.8 out of 10 and on Metacritic is scores a 75 of 100.  I think those ratings are too low.  I mean, this was directly by Martin Scorsese and has his fingerprints all over it. I LOVE Martin Scorsese!! Why do you say it's an irresponsible glorification. The characters are dull to start with and made even duller by their delusions about how very interesting that they are.  All because they are so high!  The movie is from the perspective of the stockbroker (Jordan Belfort) whom the FBI pursued. So this is a true story? It's based on a memoir written by the main character.  Opinions may vary on how true memoirs really are.  :) What was the corruption? Lol...yes, depending on whose memory is being tapped.
yes . playing football and video games . what about you ? i love video games ! i have been playing a lot of cup head ! .
we could listen to some frank sinatra only if you would dance with me will you dance with an older woman ? depends how old , cause i am an old cat lady myself round 90 but i stopped counting least you can still be up and moving around , that is a good trait yes , i like walks to the fridge , for cheese i prefer longer walks , mainly to other countries to travel . where have you traveled to ? urope , asia , and north america sia sounds really cool , and interesting .

Robert downey jr is the bomb! He brings out that character! I am really not a fan of Gwynneth Paltrow but she did ok to me. I love everything Matvel! Stan lee had an imagination didnt he? I agree, she didn't deserve the harsh criticism of her acting. What did you think of Jeff Bridges as the villain? Yeah Stan Lee has a great imagination for sure Its easy to play villians, he did great though. I think sometimes i like the villians charcters more! Wasnt Don Cheadle in this movie too? No. Terrence Howard is in this one as Col. Rhodes I am looking forward to more of this franchise. It will never get old! Me too. I liked the beginning where he gets injured in Afghanistan and he is getting the shrapnel taken out of his heart by Yinsen. Freaky!
I'm don't usually watch sports dramas but this definitely has a plot that would make you step outside the box and view. *I usually don't Yes, and it had a very good cast. Sandra Bullock is usually good in anything she does. For the cast, is that Tim McGraw the singer? The director does a good job here. Yes, Tim McGraw is a country singer. The name is familiar. Nice to see that he uses his talents for more that singing. *than Yes, and Quinton Aaron does a good job as playing the football player too... Stories like this are so good because it show how just by one person showing compassion you can change the entire trajectory of someone life. That is so true, and definitely illustrated in this movie. Scene 2 show how you will always have the naysayers. Those that do not support you when you are trying to make a difference.

Do you generally watch movies with good rating? I am not a fan of Hanks but he did his role quite well I usually don't care about the critics rating... how about you? I sometimes pay attention to the rating... I like the setting in the beginning - New Rochelle NY I felt bad that Frank missed the thrill of check kiting ... Agreed about the setting ... I love NY Christopher Walken was also good Do you remember the name of his half-sister? No True about Walken What was it? I think it was Jean
yeah they are expensive , i have 2 boys who never stop growing being colour blind , my kids go to school mismatched ! wow you color blind , anyone can help you with colors like family o , just me ! what do you do for fun ?
I for sure agree with this rating of the movie is accurate too I think it will be a classic I think it's cool he actually found his business partners in college too especially because Facebook is becoming such a common thread the movie is very informative on the background of Facebook i cant believe the movie has already been out for 8 years i think it a pretty accuate description of all of the characters i cant believe how much facebook has impacted how we interact with one another it wasn't originally called Facebook either, that's pretty interesting
i wonder what makes a film cocksure
i absolutely would love that . do you have kids ? i have a little boy o i do not . i wish i did though it is very rewarding that is for sure
what are their name , i love dogs
I liked it but I felt the beginning and middle was oversaturated with musical numbers in comparison with the last third of the movie, which had no music whatsoever. Definitely Elsa. Didn't know how to deal with her feelings Who was yours? Me too there could have been more music in the last of the movie. I liked olaf and Sven Now I'm wondering if I should rewatch it. It's been a while since I've seen it... Is that the only movie you got to read about? I have watched it with my two daughters numerous times Yes the only one mentioned Haha I'm sure you're sick of the music by now Yes I was quite over it within a month of it being released Haha which is your favorite song besides "Let It Go" Ummm, actually the song in the beginning before they open the gates. I forget the name Which was yours? Love Is An Open Door? is that the one? or maybe it's For the First Time Yes that's the one well I've tried hard to like the other songs but I still love Let it Go lol Me also and it's one of the few songs I like watching the video for

But nah, I don't see any direct competition really? It was clearly just a device to move the plot I loved when they want to the amusement park and he blew up the stand...one of the best parts of the movie also, why not rob a bank to get funding for the project?  They are bad guys Who doesn't want to blow up a rigged carnival game? And good point! I wonder if you lose your account at Bank of Evil if you rob another bank... maybe there's an arrangement...

Anyway, I think the new Batman movies are nothing comoared to this one and the sequels really. The originals were pretty cheesy they have been getting better. Not only that, but the deep flaws in the justice system were portrayed awesomely. Oh, the original Batman movies? Like the really old ones? Gotham is a special place, yea I was thinking of the silly one in 1966. The jokers has that terrible face paitn. paint*

i like all scene interested in this film Which character do you like the best? I loved the movie! Very action packed.
Okay, I'm not a big fan. But I heard the Iron Man movies were very good. It got a Rotton Tomatoes score of 92% Did the reviews say anything specific about Robert Downey Jr.? What is the movie rated? PG-13? It says his character is a team player with 2 superpowers with a sharp tongue 92% is pretty high. Even people who aren't fans of superhero movies would probably like it. I think it's PG-13 (teeny tiny letters even with the zoom - grrr.) Okay, thanks. I can take my niece and nephew then. It looks like we've chatted long enough and can finish the conversation. Thanks for all the information! Oh, good. Thanks for putting up with me. It wasn't too bad!

Haha I love this scene, when Bruce is hearing voices from god in his dead. Trying to make everyone happy! Us mortals need to have experiences like this to empathize with God... Yup! I love how he automatically answers every prayer with yes! Now he's really in a pickle Some things prayed for aren't always "Godly"; this make for humor I agree! I love when Bruce humiliates Evan on air, then Evan got fired! I laughed so hard at that part. I really didn't like Evan! I love when God apprears!

Yeah; he starred in Titanic, and he was also in this one - Catch Me If You Can. Have you seen that one? Awesome! Who else is in it? I have not. Tell me more about it. Hi! You still there? It also has Tom Hanks and Christopher Walken. Basically, Leo is like a con man! Oh wow that's a great cast. Its based on a true story too. That sounds interesting. Who is it based on? A young man named Frank Abagnale who had already pulled of several heists before he was even ninteen. What kinds of heists/cons? He pretends to be a PILOT! This was definitely before 911 and TSA then, haha. Does he actually fly the plane? Or just says he's a pilot to get women? o Oh, without a doubt. It was way back in the 60s. But, I think he does actually fly the plane too. That's wild. What other trouble does he get into? He started working for the FBI. But he wasn't really an agent? No, they actually hired him to like, prevent crooks.

I completely agree with you about Margot Robbie. She's a scene stealer in every movie she's in, and this one is no exception. And Denham has that pull too as the law and order guy. That's right. What else fascinates you about the movie? Rob Reiner showing up was a surprise to me, so that was neat as well. I don't remember him being publicized as having a part in this. You should be prepared for surprises. Right? I wasn't really sure what to think about this movie before going in. It seemed so narrow in scope, but it really was a big story. What I love about the movie, in general, is the fact that it is a comedy. You can't stop laughing. Yeah, it was a big story. It has just be narrowed down for purposes well known by the producers. But each laugh had such a bitter edge to it. It was funny but made me think twice about the butt of each joke. Funny. The sad thing is most of the characters they are not as charming as we would have loved to have instead they are dull but still manages to keep our spirits high.

Did you now? I thought it was good, but nothing more really Why did you like it so much? Well, I really liked the setting of the movie, the classic clothing, the fact it was based on an excellent book. There were only a handful of things that I didn't like about it You’re defineteky right Both setting and costumes were great And some people didn't like that it didn't follow the original story enough but what movie really does? Did you like Dicaprio as Gatsby? I haven’t read the book really. Have you? Yeah of course. I'm surprised RT only gave it a 5.8/10 Did you read the book? I did but I don't remember it closely I’m not really surprised RT has a history of giving out bad reviews in my opinion. What do you think? Well, I've seen RT give quite a good review to some movies I consider lackluster. What would have been an appropriate rating? It's like they always give an opposite opinion I'd say 7.5 Exactly, some bad movies get “good reviews” I’d give it an 8.0 really There aren't a lot of movies right now with that kind of settings and we hardly get DiCaprio in anything much You’re right about Dicaprio I guess he doesn’t really do many more films anymore

I think Joseph Gordon-Levitt did a great job too, but of course not as Good as Leonardo! haha yes sometimes side actors does pretty well see the first critical response, it is awesome The mix of military technology with corporate interests was an interesting plot. yes Christopher Nolan is one of the best Oh yes, I certainly agree...but it was even more exciting than a chess game. I kinda love each of his movies but Inception is something else to love for Me too. I could watch anything with Leonardo in it. :) haha, truly said it was released in 2009 and is still in my mind till now I liked the mazes created by Ariadne...the dreamscapes. yes that was great art and beautifully conceptualized rating wise, imdb which I follow the most, 8.8/10 is great score I feel like I want to watch it again I think it deserved at least a 9.

I thought this movie was really cute and funny - a bit different than other animations out there. I thought the references to species-ism in it were interesting. I remember Idris Elba and Jason Bateman were perfect for their roles.

Ha, you know, I remember that image from years ago.  What is the name of that actress?  Catherine...something, right?
Yes, I did, but I'm not sure I like Ben Affleck as Superman. What do you think? Well in the movie, Ben Affleck is Batman while Henry Cavilln is Superman. Ha ha...sorry, that was a typo. I knew he was Batman and typed Superman. I was really surprised that the movie had such poor critical ratings. I don't usually pay much attention to critics but it is very low for a Superman/Batman movie.

I bet they will produce toys based on the movie too, a Gru doll, etc.  Given the times we are in, it is especially fun to have an escape/adventure film like this.  Do you know what else we should address about this movie? No, I'm not sure what else they want us to cover... I thought it was going to change documents after four comments but I'm not sure.

It's a fun movie all around. Beautiful scenery, pretty exciting scenes Awesome. Are you a fan of Decaprio and Hanks? And if you liked the movie Now You See Me, it's actually very much like that. Has an Oceans 11 vibe, where you keep wondering how he's going to get away with it. Yea I don't think I've ever seen a bad movie from either of them. Interesting I really loved Leo in Inception and Gangs of New York. I loved both oceans 11 and now you see me Then I definitely think you will enjoy this movie. I won't give away the ending, but it is very unique. I believe I've seen inception but not gangs of New York Gangs of New York was great, but very violent.
